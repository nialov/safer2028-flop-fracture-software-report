	abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning is used to capture the geometry of three single folded bedding surfaces. The resulting light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point clouds are filtered and smoothed to enable meshing and calculation of principal curvatures. Fracture traces, picked from the LIDAR data, are used to calculate fracture densities. The rich data sets produced by this method provide statistically robust estimates of spatial variations in fracture density across the fold surface. The digital nature of the data also allows resampling to derive fracture parameters that are more traditionally measured manually from outcrops (e.g., one-dimensional line transects of fracture spacing). The fracture statistics derived from the LIDAR data are compared with the calculated principal and Gaussian curvatures of the surface to assess whether areas of extreme curvature correlate with high-fracture density. For the folds studied, all the fracture spacing distributions showed an exponential distribution, and no significant correlation between fracture density and surface curvature was observed. This questions the validity of using curvature as a proxy for high brittle strains and highlights the need for a complete understanding of fold and fracture mechanics that include considerations of other factors including lithology, strain rate, and confining pressure, not just finite strain. The three case studies also illustrate how terrestrial laser scanning can be used to gather detailed quantitative data sets on fracture and fold distributions from outcrop analogs.},

Of particular importance are the distributions and spatial variations of different geometric (locations, orientation, length, etc.) and topological (intersections, connectivity, etc.) ­attributes of fractures in a network. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide a means to map and digitize two-dimensional fracture networks from a variety of field and remote sensing data and to display the results in the form of quality maps. We introduce NetworkGT, an open-source toolbox for ArcGIS capable of efficient sampling, analysis, and spatial mapping of geometric and topological attributes of two-dimensional fracture networks. The toolbox helps to extract and plot geometric and topological information from a given two-dimensional fracture network including: rose diagrams, plots of frequency distribution and topology, and maps of topological parameters. Using a fracture network example from offshore NW Devon, United Kingdom, we illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the toolbox. This includes computing a contour grid with 1326 subsampled regions within the fracture network, which is used to demonstrate the quantitative capabilities of the toolbox and the ability to spatially map important network properties. The toolbox will help to facilitate the increasing application of geometry and topology in the analysis and comparison of fracture networks at a range of scales. Furthermore, the integration of the NetworkGT toolbox into ArcGIS allows two-dimensional fracture networks to be interpreted, mapped, and fully analyzed within the same software package.},

	abstract = {The glaciﬂuvial deposits within formerly glaciated areas of southern Finland comprise the predominance of wellsorted subglacial and ice marginal sediments. The deposits are less than 100 m thick and form signiﬁcant aquifers utilized by the respective areas. The spatial correlation of subglacial deposits with bedrock structures, particularly the deformation zones, has been long recognized, but most often not systematically investigated. The purpose of this study was to understand how speciﬁc bedrock structures control the position and processes of formation of glaciﬂuvial deposits, using the First Salpausselkä area of southern Finland as a model area. We apply a means of structural analysis to compile structural interpretations (form lines and 3D-surfaces) of the bedrock and correlate the results with the patterns of the glaciﬂuvial deposits and the topography of the underlying bedrock surface. Two major E–W striking shear zones deﬁning abrupt breaks at the bedrock surface along with secondary SW–NE striking splays, originating from the horsetail-like termination of the Somero shear zone, control the deposition of eskers and ice marginal deposits. Based on correlations between the bedrock topography, glacial erosion and sedimentation, we infer that laterally extensive shear zones may have indirectly affected the glacial dynamics within the areas of areal scour more than previously considered. Recognized deformation zones are important for modelling the internal stratigraphy of glaciﬂuvial deposits, their hydrogeological properties and for mapping fresh water supplies within the Nordic countries and other glaciated areas which have undergone substantial tectonic deformation. The development of 3D geologic models is essential for understanding regional-scale correlations between Quaternary sediments and bedrock structures.},

	abstract = {A major use of DFN models for industrial applications is to evaluate permeability and ﬂow structure in hardrock aquifers from geological observations of fracture networks. The relationship between the statistical fracture density distributions and permeability has been extensively studied, but there has been little interest in the spatial structure of DFN models, which is generally assumed to be spatially random (i.e., Poisson). In this paper, we compare the predictions of Poisson DFNs to new DFN models where fractures result from a growth process deﬁned by simpliﬁed kinematic rules for nucleation, growth, and fracture arrest. This so-called ‘‘kinematic fracture model’’ is characterized by a large proportion of T intersections, and a smaller number of intersections per fracture. Several kinematic models were tested and compared with Poisson DFN models with the same density, length, and orientation distributions. Connectivity, permeability, and ﬂow distribution were calculated for 3-D networks with a self-similar power law fracture length distribution. For the same statistical properties in orientation and density, the permeability is systematically and signiﬁcantly smaller by a factor of 1.5–10 for kinematic than for Poisson models. In both cases, the permeability is well described by a linear relationship with the areal density p32, but the threshold of kinematic models is 50\% larger than of Poisson models. Flow channeling is also enhanced in kinematic DFN models. This analysis demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate DFN organization for predicting ﬂow properties from fracture network parameters.},

We believe that one of the fundamental reasons for this problem is strongly related to subjective deﬁnitions and inconsistent uses of the term ‘damage zone’. Thus, ﬁrstly we classify damage zones into along-fault, around-tip and cross-fault damage zones based on descriptive views of an arbitrary fault exposure as well as their tridimensional locations around a segmented fault system. Secondly, we propose an advanced ﬁeld technique and data acquisition method to more accurately deﬁne a damage zone using the distribution of cumulative fracture frequency. We tested this method on new ﬁeld and borehole observations as well as previously published data to identify damage zone boundaries, and express them as a change in slope gradients of the cumulative distribution of deformation structures. The results show how this slope change can be a useful criterion in accurately deﬁning the width of damage zones and some internal properties of fault zones. We argue that this damage zone classiﬁcation and deﬁnition method should be adopted and used to prevent discrepancies in ﬁeld data. This will help us to gain a better understanding of fault damage zone properties and their scaling with fault displacement.},

	abstract = {Fluid flow modeling of naturally fractured reservoirs remains a challenge because of the complex nature of fracture systems controlled by various chemical and physical phenomena. A discrete fracture network (DFN) model represents an approach to capturing the relationship of fractures in a fracture system. Topology represents the connectivity aspect of the fracture planes, which have a fundamental role in flow simulation in geomaterials involving fractures and the rock matrix. Therefore, one of the most‐used methods to treat fractured reservoirs is the double porositydouble permeability model. This approach requires the shape factor calculation, a key parameter used to determine the effects of coupled fracture‐matrix fluid flow on the mass transfer between different domains. This paper presents a numerical investigation that aimed to evaluate the impact of fracture topology on the shape factor and equivalent permeability through hydraulic connectivity (f). This study was based on numerical simulations of flow performed in discrete fracture network (DFN) models embedded in finite element meshes (FEM). Modeled cases represent four hypothetical examples of fractured media and three real scenarios extracted from a Brazilian presalt carbonate reservoir model. We have compared the results of the numerical simulations with data obtained using Oda’s analytical model and Oda’s correction approach, considering the hydraulic connectivity f. The simulations showed that the equivalent permeability and the shape factor are strongly influenced by the hydraulic connectivity (f) in synthetic scenarios for X and Ynode topological patterns, which showed the higher value for f (0.81) and more expressive values for upscaled permeability (kx‐node = 0.1151 and ky‐node = 0.1153) and shape factor (25.6 and 14.5), respectively. We have shown that the analytical methods are not efficient for estimating the equivalent permeability of the fractured medium, including when these methods were corrected using topological aspects.},

The network is described in terms of fracture density, orientation, and length distribution parameters. Of particular interest is the role of fracture cross connections and abutments on the effective permeability. Hence, the ﬂow simulations explicitly account for network topology by adopting Discrete-Fracture-and-Matrix description. The interior of the Latemar carbonate platform (Dolomites, Italy) is taken as outcrop analogue for subsurface reservoirs of isolated carbonate build-ups that exhibit a fracture-dominated permeability. New is our dual strategy to describe the fracture network both as deterministic- and stochastic-based inputs for ﬂow simulations. The fracture geometries are captured explicitly and form a multiscale data set by integration of interpretations from outcrops, airborne imagery, and lidar. The deterministic network descriptions form the basis for descriptive rules that are diagnostic of the complex natural fracture arrangement. The fracture networks exhibit a variable degree of multitier hierarchies with smaller-sized fractures abutting against larger fractures under both right and oblique angles. The inﬂuence of network topology on connectivity is quantiﬁed using Discrete-Fracture-Single phase ﬂuid ﬂow simulations. The simulation results show that the effective permeability for the fracture and matrix ensemble can be 50 to 400 times higher than the matrix permeability of 1.0 · 10À14 m2. The permeability enhancement is strongly controlled by the connectivity of the fracture network. Therefore, the degree of intersecting and abutting fractures should be captured from outcrops with accuracy to be of value as analogue.},

The degree of recrystallization has been determined at 10-20, {\textasciitilde} 50 and 100\%, respectively. We demonstrate that dynamic recrystallization is a sequential process involving subgrain-grain rotation and grainboundary migration. It initiates via subgrain polygonization on a single crystal slip system, and continues via subgrain and neoblast rotation on several slip systems. In the early stages of recrystallization ({\textless} 50\%), the orientation relationships between subgrains-neoblasts and parent grains are systematic and are related to the dominantly active crystal slip systems. Beyond {\textasciitilde} 50\% recrystallization, orientation relationships are less systematic and this is attributed to an increase in the activity of grain-boundary migration. However, dynamic recrystallization is potentially a cyclical process with new subgrains forming within migrational neoblasts due to continued deformation. The three sequences represent different stages in the same continuous, time- or strain-dependent, dynamic recrystallization history. They therefore combine to give a generalized dynamic recrystallization history for greenschist facies quartz grains at low to moderate strains. Porphyroclasts have similar recrystallization histories because the original bimodal grain size distribution leads to strain partitioning, allowing the porphyroclasts to rotate into weak orientations with the subsequent activation of weak crystal slip systems.},

The geometrical analytical approach (vein thickness, shape, size, spacing, fractal distribution, etc.) to characterize the vein networks is not reliable because of vein deformation, modification of their shapes and relative positions, and/or of limited observations due to drill core thickness. To the opposite, the number of auriferous veins per length unit and the topology are the most reliable tools to characterize vein arrays that underwent high-grade metamorphism. Application of these methods in the gold-bearing Cheechoo system shows that the gold mineralization is controlled by the number and associated connectivity of the Qtz veinlets, and to a minor extent of the Qtz-Fsp-Di veins. To the opposite, pegmatites and Chl veins only locally remobilize the gold mineralization.},

	abstract = {New observations of fracture corridors .150 m tall and planes of bedding-parallel slip are integrated with sedimentological descriptions of the Asmari Formation to understand the main controls on the development of fractures in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. In the Kuh-e Pahn, foldrelated fracture corridors are axis-parallel (NW–SE) and occur in the crest of the anticline. They form by neutral surface folding, but at a critical dip of the beds (c. 158), bedding-parallel slip by ﬂexural slip folding is the predominant mechanism. This relationship is substantiated by curvature calculations. Crestal fractures have a large vertical extent in mechanical unit B (.150 m), primarily due to the lithological homogeneity of massive packstones within the Asmari Formation. Northerly and easterly trending fracture corridors, interpreted from satellite imagery, are spatially unrelated to the detachment folding of the cover series, but represent the distributed effect of deepseated basement reactivation related to fault movement. These trends deﬁne high production zones in the nearby Gachsaran super giant oilﬁeld. Observations from an adjacent eroded box fold, the Kuh-e Mish, with steeper dipping limbs (608), revealed a contrast in the style of deformation, and we interpret these folds to represent different stages in box fold evolution.},

	abstract = {We used drone-acquired orthophotographs to map the 2D-networks of fractures transecting the Mesoproterozoic Rapakivi granites in southern Finland. The work aims at understanding i) how discrete faults and the kine­ matically linked syn-fault extension fractures originate in crystalline rocks, and ii) how the resulting structural anisotropy controls the patterns of later-formed regional fractures. We recognized incipient faults with associated distinct damage zones (DZ; wall-, tip-, bend- and linking damage) indicating that faulting occurred within mesoscopically isotropic material devoid of pre-existing fabrics. Moreover, fault-induced extension fractures occur also outside the normal DZs indicating much wider DZs than that predicted by scaling laws. Extension fractures within the wide DZs are the result of linkage between sub-parallel segments of the dominantly sinistral and {\textasciitilde}N-S trending (sub-) vertical faults. The resulting syn-fault network of N-S, NW-SE and NE-SW trending fracture sets contributed to the mechanical anisotropy that controlled the patterns of the later-formed regional fractures. Specifically, i) narrow fault reactivation damage zones caused deviations in the patterns of otherwise systematic near-orthogonal regional fractures, and ii) the NNW-SSE trending regional fractures are poorly developed in areas where either several N-S faults or sub-parallel NW-SE syn-fault extension fractures are dominant. The latter applies in particular to a large left step-over zone between sinistral faults, which we infer to provide the first-order control over the development of contrasting fracture domains. The results of this study further indicate that a strike-slip paleostress event affected the crust after ca. 1.65 Ga.},

	abstract = {Sensor miniaturisation, improved battery technology and the availability of low-cost yet advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have provided new opportunities for environmental remote sensing. The UAV provides a platform for close-range aerial photography. Detailed imagery captured from micro-UAV can produce dense point clouds using multi-view stereopsis (MVS) techniques combining photogrammetry and computer vision. This study applies MVS techniques to imagery acquired from a multi-rotor micro-UAV of a natural coastal site in southeastern Tasmania, Australia. A very dense point cloud ({\textless}1–3 cm point spacing) is produced in an arbitrary coordinate system using full resolution imagery, whereas other studies usually downsample the original imagery. The point cloud is sparse in areas of complex vegetation and where surfaces have a homogeneous texture. Ground control points collected with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) are identiﬁed and used for georeferencing via a Helmert transformation. This study compared georeferenced point clouds to a Total Station survey in order to assess and quantify their geometric accuracy. The results indicate that a georeferenced point cloud accurate to 25–40 mm can be obtained from imagery acquired from ∼50 m. UAV-based image capture provides the spatial and temporal resolution required to map and monitor natural landscapes. This paper assesses the accuracy of the generated point clouds based on ﬁeld survey points. Based on our key ﬁndings we conclude that sub-decimetre terrain change (in this case coastal erosion) can be monitored.},

The observations have been collected and classified into a file geodatabase with ArcGis (© ESRI) using a procedure that includes several steps.

We illustrate these types of analysis using the example of faults and fractures, which typically form networks of interacting and connected segments. A framework for describing and characterising fault and fracture networks is presented for each of the structural analysis types. We suggest that any structural study be tailored to suit the desired outcome and that this scheme of analysis types should be used as a basis for the development of workflows, for the design of research projects and for testing hypotheses. For example, prediction of fluid flow through a fracture network must begin with the basic geological description of fracture types. Basic geological descriptions should be followed by measuring their geometries and topologies, understanding their age relationships, kinematic and mechanics, and developing a realistic, data-led model for related fluid flow. Missing steps can lead to fundamentally flawed interpretations.},

We broaden the idea of linkage to include structures around the intersections of non-parallel and/or nonsynchronous faults. These interaction damage zones can be divided into approaching damage zones, where the faults kinematically interact but are not physically connected, and intersection damage zones, where the faults either abut or cross-cut. The damage zone concept is applied to other settings in which strain or displacement variations are taken up by a range of structures, such as at fault bends. It is recommended that a preﬁx can be added to a wide range of damage zones, to describe the locations in which they formed, e.g., approaching, intersection and fault bend damage zone. Such interpretations are commonly based on limited knowledge of the 3D geometries of the structures, such as from exposure surfaces, and there may be spatial variations. For example, approaching faults and related damage seen in outcrop may be intersecting elsewhere on the fault planes.},

The methodology is tested in an active mineral exploration terrain within the Paleoproterozoic Pera¨ pohja Belt (PB) in the Northern Fennoscandian Shield, Finland. The PB comprises a greenschist to amphibolite facies, complexly deformed supracrustal sequence of variable quartzites, maﬁc volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks, carbonate rocks, black shales, mica schists and graywackes. These formations were deposited on Archean basement and 2.44 Ga layered intrusions, during the multiple rifting of the Archean basement (2.44–1.92 Ga). Younger intrusive units in the PB comprise 2.20–2.13 Ga gabbroic sills or dikes and 1.98 Ga A-type granites. Metamorphism and complex deformation of the PB took place during the Svecofennian orogeny (1.9–1.8 Ga) and were followed by intrusions of post-orogenic granitoids (1.81–1.77 Ga). The recent mineral exploration activities have indicated several gold-bearing mineral occurrences within the PB. The Rompas Au-U mineralization is hosted within deformed and metamorphosed calc-silicate veins enclosed within maﬁc volcanic rocks and contains uranium-bearing zones without gold and very high-grade ({\textgreater}10,000 g/t Au) gold pockets with uraninite and uraninite-pyrobitumen nodules. In the vicinity of the Rompas, a magnesium skarn hosted disseminated-stockwork gold mineralization was also recognized at the Palokas-Rajapalot prospect. The exploration criteria translated into a fuzzy logic prospectivity model included data derived from regional till geochemistry (Fe, Cu, Co, Ni, Au, Te, K), high-resolution airborne geophysics (magnetic ﬁeld total intensity, electromagnetic, gamma radiation), ground gravity and regional bedrock map (structures). The current exploration licenses and exploration drilling sites for gold were used to validate the knowledge-driven mineral prospectivity model.},

A simple scheme to transform IX systems into IYX systems is developed that allows the expected value of dimensionless branch intensity (B22C) at the percolation threshold to be derived for any network topology.

	abstract = {The ground comprises the solid and continuous surface of the Earth. The crystalline crust, i.e. bedrock, is exposed or covered with sediments and vegetation. The morphology of the ground surface is influenced by a combination of tectonometamorphic- magmatic processes (building up) and denudation/erosion processes (tearing down). Landforms are related to these processes and the character of the bedrock (lithologies and structures), and the distribution of soil or other unconsolidated, superficial material. By using remote-sensing techniques applied for structural analysis of the ground surface, it is possible to map features in the terrain that are related to bedrock structures provided that the topography of the bedrock surface is not totally concealed below a cover of soil or other loose material. Even though the sedimentary cover is relatively thick it may be distorted and the ground surface displaced by late faulting in the basement rock. Studies of the relation between structures in the bedrock and the topography started more than 150 years ago. Hobbs (1903, 1912) introduced the fundamental concept of 'lineaments' and described them as 'significant lines in the Earth's face' and later he concluded that they are 'lines in the landscape which reveal the hidden architecture of the basement'. When airborne geophysical measurements started approximately fifty years ago such data were used to compliment the topographical interpretation of basement structures. Source data for studies of lineaments consist of information on the topography (e.g. topographical maps, aerial photos, elevation data, multi-spectral sensing, laser, radar and thermography) and geophysical data (e.g. airborne geophysical data comprising magnetic, electromagnetic, radiation measurements, and gravimetric measurements). The outcome of a lineament study depends on the terrain in the investigated area, the source data, the approach and systematic performance in the interpretation, and the skill of the interpreter. Images and digital terrain models that display the relief of the studied area should, if possible, be illuminated in at least four directions to reduce biases regarding the orientation of structures. The resolution in the source data should be fully used and extrapolation of structures avoided in the primary interpretation of the source data. The interpretation of lineaments should be made in steps: a. Interpretation of each data set/image/terrain model is conducted separately; b. Compilation of all interpretations in a base lineament map and classification of the lineaments; and c. Construction of thematical maps, e.g. structural maps, rock block maps, and statistic presentation of lineaments. Generalisations and extrapolations of lineaments/structures may be made when producing the thematical maps. The construction of thematical maps should be supported by auxiliary information (geological and geomorphologic data and information on human impact in the area). Inferred tectonic structures should be controlled in field},

	abstract = {The main landforms within the glacially scoured Precambrian rocks of the Swedish west coast are closely connected to the principal structural pattern and have lately been explained as mainly a result of etch processes, probably during the Mesozoic and with a possible second period of etching during the Neogene. To explore the effect of multiple glacial erosion on the rock surfaces, an island with two different lithologies and with striae from different directions was selected for a detailed study, focusing on the shape of roches moutonne´es. Air-photo interpretation of bedrock lineaments and roches moutonne´es combined with detailed ﬁeld mapping and striae measurements are used to interpret the structural and lithological control on the resulting shape. The study reveals a signiﬁcant difference in shape between roches moutonne´es in augen-granite and orthogneiss. Low elongated and streamlined roches moutonne´es occur in the gneiss area, striated by a Late Weichselian ice ﬂow from the NE. This ice ﬂow is subparallel with both the local dominant trend of topographically well-expressed joints and the schistosity of the gneiss. Frequently, there are no signs of quarrying on the lee-sides of the gneiss roches moutonne´es and hence they resemble the shape of whalebacks, or ruwares, as typically associated with the exposed basal weathering surface found in tropical areas. The granite roches moutonne´es were formed by an older ice ﬂow from the ESE, which closely followed the etched WNW–ESE joint system of the granite. Late Weichselian ice ﬂow from the NE caused only minor changes of the landforms. On the contrary, marks of the early ESE ice ﬂow are poorly preserved in the gneiss area, where it probably never had any large effect as the ﬂow was perpendicular to both schistosity and structures and, accordingly, also to the pre-glacial relief. The study demonstrates that coincidence between ice ﬂow direction and pre-glacially etched structures is most likely to determine the effects of glacial erosion.

	abstract = {A workflow is presented that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery with discrete fracture network (DFN) geometric characterization and quantification of fluid flow. The DFN analysis allows for reliable characterization and reproduction of the most relevant features of fracture networks, including: identification of orientation sets and their characteristics (mean orientation, dispersion, and prior probability); scale invariance in distributions of fracture length and spatial location/clustering; and the distribution of aperture values used to compute network-scale equivalent permeability. A two-dimensional DFN-generation approach honors field data by explicitly reproducing observed multi-scale fracture clustering using a multiplicative cascade process and power law distribution of fracture length. The influence of aperture on network-scale equivalent permeability is investigated using comparisons between a sublinear aperture-to-length relationship and constant aperture. To assess the applicability of the developed methodology, DFN flow simulations are calibrated to pumping test data. Results suggest that even at small scales, UAV surveys capture the essential geometrical properties required for fluid flow characterization. Both the constant and sublinear aperture scaling approaches provide good matches to the pumping test results with only minimal calibration, indicating that the reproduced networks sufficiently capture the geometric and connectivity properties characteristic of the granitic rocks at the study site. The sublinear aperture scaling case honors the directions of dominant fractures that play a critical role in connecting fracture clusters and provides a realistic representation of network permeability.},

The size and form of roches moutonnees are closely connected with the frequency and state of joints in the bedrock. The fewer and smaller the joints are, the larger are the roches moutonnees that can be formed. Vertical joints in the direction of the ice movement form the weakest zones and determine the width of the roches moutonnees. Joints dipping against glacial movement determine the dip of the eroded rock surface. Horizontal joints provide a suitable base for large and gently-dipping roches moutonnees, which are normally lower than others with less frequent horizontal joints. Striae, friction cracks,facets, fracture lines, and plucked surfaces, and their positions on the surfaces of roches moutonnees, were observed. On the basis of these observations, a stereographic model of the distribution of different abrasion features on the surfaces of roches moutonnees was produced.},

	abstract = {Damage zones of different fault types are investigated in siliciclastics (Utah, USA), carbonates (Majella Mountain, Italy) and metamorphic rocks (western Norway). The study was conducted taking measurements of deformation features such as fractures and deformation bands on multiple 1D scanlines along fault walls. The resulting datasets are used to plot the frequency distribution of deformation features and to constrain the geometrical width of the damage zone for the studied faults. The damage-zone width of a single fault is constrained by identifying the changes in the slope of cumulative plots made on the frequency data. The cumulative plot further shows high deformation frequency by a steep slope (inner damage zone) and less deformation as a gentle slope (outer damage zone). Statistical distributions of displacement and damage-zone width and their relationship are improved, and show two-slope power-law distributions with a break point at c. 100 m displacement. Bleached sandstones in the studied siliciclastic rocks of Utah are associated with a higher frequency of deformation bands and a wider damage zone compared to the unbleached zone of similar lithology. Fault damage zones in the carbonate rocks of Majella are often host to open fractures (karst), demonstrating that they can also be conductive to ﬂuid ﬂow.},

	abstract = {In order to simulate water ﬂow in discrete fracture networks, a Graph-theoretic Pipe Network Method (GPNM) is proposed. Firstly, identiﬁcation of water ﬂow pathways is considered and a tree cutting technique is adopted. Then each fracture in a discrete fracture network is treated as a weighted pipe with a starting node and an ending node in an oriented graph. A node law of ﬂow rate and a pipe law of pressure in discrete fracture networks are derived based on the conservation of mass and energy, respectively. Boundaries and fractures are uniﬁed with the same form of a uniﬁed governing equation. Solutions of water pressures and ﬂow rates in discrete fracture networks are obtained by solving a system of nonhomogeneous linear equations. Since no discretization is needed, GPNM is demonstrated with high efﬁciency. In addition, a few case studies are implemented and compared with those from analytical solutions or numerical analysis using the software, Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). It shows that the proposed Graph-theoretic Pipe Network Method (GPNM) is effective in analyzing water ﬂow in discrete fracture networks. Moreover, GPNM is promising for more engineering applications, and can be used for large scales of water simulation problems with numerous fractures.},

	abstract = {A fractured rock mass was characterized by strong heterogeneity, discontinuity, and anisotropy. The study of ﬂow in a fractured rock mass was a complex and challenging task. As the main seepage channels of a fractured rock mass, the fracture network was mainly affected by the fracture density, trace length, aperture, and direction angle. In this paper, the inﬂuence of fracture parameters on the permeability of the fracture network was studied by orthogonal experimental design and numerical modeling. A series of fracture networks were established to obtain seepage rules and permeability. The results showed that the increase in fracture density, trace length, and aperture increased the permeability of the model and that the fracture direction angle affected the pressure gradient and the anisotropy of the seepage in the model. The sensitivity of effective parameters on the discrete fracture network permeability performance was obtained. The inﬂuence factors of K1 were density, trace length, aperture, and direction angle in that order. The inﬂuence factors of K2 were direction angle, density, aperture, and trace length, in that order. The inﬂuence factors of K1/K2 were direction angle and density, aperture, and trace length in that order. These results could be used for parameter adjustment of fracture network modeling and determining the complex seepage characteristics in naturally fractured reservoirs.

	abstract = {Two approaches for determining the stability of fractal dimensions (D) for fracture patterns in granite are examined. First, the stability of fractal dimensions for 1-D ®eld measurements of joint spacing was investigated with respect to the number of measurements needed. At least 100±150 spacing measurements per joint set produced stable or accurate fractal dimensions where joints were regularly clustered and relatively regularly and widely spaced. Other spatial patterns require greater numbers of measurements per set. The stability of D for 1-D data is thus likely to depend on the spatial distribution of the joints within each joint set. Second, an alternate approach to estimate stable fractal dimensions based on scale invariance was explored. A combination of 1-D ®eld data and 1- and 2-D image data was used. Fractal dimensions for the ®eld data, which are unstable, ranged from 0.70±0.84, and for the image patterns, D ranged from 1.63±1.69, suggesting a 2-D fractal dimension of 1.7 for fractures in this area. These results suggest that the combined use of dierent data types with dierent dimensionality may overcome the problem of unstable fractal dimensions and allow reasonable estimates of stable fractal dimensions to be made. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The brittle deformation history of southwestern Finland was reconstructed through paleostress inversion of fault-slip data from outcrops and drill cores at the site of a planned nuclear waste repository. Seven distinct paleostress states have been resolved spanning 1.7 Ga of geological history. (1) NWeSE to NNW eSSE transpression acted soon after 1.75 Ga, when conditions leading to brittle deformation were ﬁrst attained. (2) NeS to NEeSW transpression caused partial reactivation of (1). (3) NWeSE extension followed during the Gothian event and at the time of rapakivi magmatism. (4) Renewed NEeSW transtension occurred between 1.60 and 1.30 Ga, forming the NWeSE-elongated Satakunta graben. (5) A signiﬁcant and so far unrecognised phase of NEeSW compression has been found to postdate both rapakivi granites and 1.27 Ga olivine diabase sills. (6) EeW transpression followed during the early stages of the Mesoproterozoic Sveconorwegian orogeny and predated (7) almost coaxial EeW extension of the late Sveconorwegian orogenic collapse. Our results prove that the shield's ‘crust fragmentation’ (i.e. generation of new fractures) was short lived in comparison to its ‘jostling phase’ (i.e. reactivation of old fractures). The shield thus reached structural maturity with respect to its saturation with brittle structures already in the late Mesoproterozoic. We predict that that future stress changes will most probably be accommodated by reactivation of the existing and inherited brittle structures rather than by formation of new deformation zones.},

	abstract = {Damage zones show very similar geometries across a wide range of scales and fault types, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faults. We use a geometric classiﬁcation of damage zones into tip-, wall-, and linking-damage zones, based on their location around faults. These classes can be subdivided in terms of fault and fracture patterns within the damage zone. A variety of damage zone structures can occur at mode II tips of strike-slip faults, including wing cracks, horsetail fractures, antithetic faults, and synthetic branch faults. Wall damage zones result from the propagation of mode II and mode III fault tips through a rock, or from damage associated with the increase in slip on a fault. Wall damage zone structures include extension fractures, antithetic faults, synthetic faults, and rotated blocks with associated triangular openings. The damage formed at the mode III tips of strike-slip faults (e.g. observed in cliff sections) are classiﬁed as wall damage zones, because the damage zone structures are distributed along a fault trace in map view. Mixed-mode tips are likely to show characteristics of both mode II and mode III tips. Linking damage zones are developed at steps between two sub-parallel faults, and the structures developed depend on whether the step is extensional or contractional. Extension fractures and pull-aparts typically develop in extensional steps, whilst solution seams, antithetic faults and synthetic faults commonly develop in contractional steps. Rotated blocks, isolated lenses or strike-slip duplexes may occur in both extensional and contractional steps.},

Four important fracture data collection methods are linear scanline sampling, areal sampling, window sampling and circular scanline sampling. In regions of homogeneous fracture networks these methods are adequate to characterise fracture patterns for use as outcrop analogues, however where fractures are heterogeneous, it is more difﬁcult to characterise fracture networks and a different approach is needed. We develop a workﬂow for fracture data collection in a region of heterogeneous fractures in a fold and thrust belt, which we believe has applicability to a wide variety of fracture networks in different tectonic settings. We use an augmented circular scanline method, along with areal sampling to collect a range of fracture attribute data, including orientation, length, aperture, spatial distribution and intensity. This augmented circular scanline method more than halves the time taken for data collection, provides accurate, unbiased data that is representative of local fracture network attributes and involves data collection of a wider range of fracture attributes than other sampling techniques alone.},

	abstract = {Surface roughness of rock discontinuities is an important factor that determines the strength characteristics of rock mass. Joint roughness coefficient (JRC), which is typically measured by means of Barton’s combs in the field, is widely used to describe the joint roughness. However, this traditional method of measurement can be rather subjective, labor-intensive and time consuming. In contrast, photogrammetry can provide an alternative method to obtain relatively simple and fast measurements of JRC based on high resolution 3D models. However, the reliability of such measurements still remains an issue as the results from photogrammetry can be affected by the quality of images. This study seeks to clarify whether photogrammetry can produce accurate measurements of JRC that can be used to assess the stability of slopes. A rock slope with a recent wedge failure in the Gold Coast area, Australia was selected for this purpose, and three different methods such as manual measurements, photogrammetry, and tilt tests were employed to determine the JRC. The obtained results showed some discrepancy in the values of JRC obtained from these three different measurements. In particular, the JRC obtained using the Barton’s comb had slightly higher values compared to those determined through the photogrammetry method while the tilt test results tended to yield overestimated values of JRC. Computer analysis using Universal Distinct Element Code was also performed to study the effect of JRC variation on the slope stability. It was found that an increase in the JRC led to an increase in the safety factor of the slope.},

Even though the active chimneys have grown on a basaltic ridge, geochemical ﬂuid data show a strong sedimentary inﬂuence into the hydrothermal circulation at Loki’s Castle. Compelling evidence for a sediment input is given by high alkalinity, high concentrations of NH4+, H2, CH4, C2+ hydrocarbons as well as low Mn and Fe contents. The low d13C values of CO2 and CH4 and the thermogenic isotopic pattern of the C2+ hydrocarbons in the high-temperature vent ﬂuids clearly point to thermal degradation of sedimentary organic matter and illustrate diminution of the natural carbon sequestration in sediments by hydrothermal circulation. Thus, carbon-release to the hydrosphere in Arctic regions is especially relevant in areas where the active Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge system is in contact with the organic matter rich detrital sediment fans.},

	abstract = {Two quantitative measures – correlation dimension and maximum Lyapunov exponent – are investigated for quantifying fracture spacing in massive, non-layered rock. The correlation dimension, a measure of fractal dimension, characterizes some aspects of fracture distribution. Relative to other fractal methods used in structural geology, the correlation dimension provides a more rigorous mathematical calculation of the fractal dimension and is particularly robust in cases where data is limited. The maximum Lyapunov exponent calculation also provides quantiﬁcation of observed distributions of fracture spacing, emphasizing variations in adjacent spacing measurements. The two methods are tested on two different synthetic data sets, to elucidate their usefulness in distinguishing between different distributions, and their sensitivity to population size, average fracture spacing, and standard deviation. Both methods provide accurate results for small population sizes and for a range of average fracture spacings. These methods are then used together to quantify two different fracture sets in the granitoids of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The results indicate that the different fracture sets – inferred to form from different tectonic processes – have distinctive and quantiﬁable differences in patterns of fracture spacing.},

This commonly used technique, however, suffers from several biases. In this contribution, we present the influence of (1) scale, (2) illumination azimuth and (3) operator, which significantly affect results of remote sensing expressed as number, orientation and length of the mapped lineaments. Six operators (N1–N6) with differing experience in remote sensing and different Earth sciences backgrounds mapped the same LiDAR DEM of a fractured bedrock terrain located in western Norway at three different scales (1:20.000, 1:10.000, 1:5.000) and illuminated from three different azimuths (045°, 180°, 315°). The 54 lineament maps show considerable output variability depending on the three factors: (1) at larger scales, both the number and the orientation variability of picked lineaments increase, whereas the line lengths generally decrease. (2) Linear features oriented perpendicular to the source of illumination are preferentially enhanced. (3) Inter-operator result reproducibility is generally poor. Operators have different perceptions of what is a lineament. Ironically, this is particularly obvious for the results of the “most experienced” operators, seemingly reflecting a stronger conceptual bias of what lineaments are and an operational bias on how they should be mapped. Based on these results, we suggest guidelines aimed to improve the reliability of remote sensing lineament interpretations.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientiﬁc interest and have signiﬁcant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large ﬂuctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the diﬃculty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares ﬁtting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood ﬁtting methods with goodness-of-ﬁt tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of diﬀerent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a powerlaw distribution. In some cases we ﬁnd these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {The Markland test is one of the most diffused and adopted methods of kinematic analysis for the identiﬁcation of critical intersections of rock discontinuities that could generate rock failures. Traditionally, the kinematic analysis is based on the use of a stereographic approach that is able to identify the critical combination between the orientations of discontinuities and the rock wall. The recent improvements in the use of Digital Outcrop Models (DOMs) created the conditions for the development of a new automatized approach. We present ROck Slope Kinematic Analysis (ROKA) which is an open-source algorithm aimed at performing the Kinematic Analysis using the discontinuity measures collected onto a 3D DOM. The presented algorithm is able to make a local identiﬁcation of the possible critical combination between the identiﬁed discontinuities and the orientation of the slope. Using this approach, the algorithm is able to identify on the slope the presence of critical combinations according to the traditional kinematic analysis of planar failure, ﬂexural toppling, wedge failure, and direct toppling modes of failures and then visualize them on DOMs. In this way, the traditional approach is more effective and can be adopted for a more detailed analysis of large and complex areas.},

All geological data sets are spatially limited and have limited resolution. Geoscientists who interpret such data sets must, therefore, rely upon their previous experience and apply a limited set of geological concepts. We have documented the range of interpretations to a single data set, and in doing so have quantified the “conceptual uncertainty” inherent in seismic interpretation. In this experiment, 412 interpretations of a synthetic seismic image were analyzed. Only 21\% of the participants interpreted the “correct” tectonic setting of the original model, and only 23\% highlighted the three main fault strands in the image. These results illustrate that conceptual uncertainty exists, which in turn explains the large range of interpretations that can result from a single data set. We consider the role of prior knowledge in biasing individuals in their interpretation of the synthetic seismic section, and our results demonstrate that conceptual uncertainty has a critical influence on resource exploration and other areas of geoscience. Practices should be developed to minimize the effects of conceptual uncertainty, and it should be accounted for in risk analysis.},

Brittle faults are numerous in the Fennoscandian Palaeoproterozoic bedrock, but only some of them have relative age constraints, while absolute ages are nearly lacking. Sedimentary rocks altogether are uncommon in Finland and only sparsely dated by micropaleontological studies. This study reports K–Ar data of fresh, non-weathered authigenic illite and constrains a time framework for the local faulting and sedimentation. The Neoproterozoic Tonian to Cryogenian ages derived from the grains in diminishing grain-size order are c. 967, 947, 809 and 697 Ma. Results indicate that the formation of the extension fracture is related to the collapse of Sveconorwegian orogeny c. 1000 Ma; clay and mature quartz sand were deposited in this extension fracture in shallow water in an intracratonic basin followed by early diagenetic processes and neocrystallization of illite around 967–947 Ma. The Neoproterozoic 1000–700 Ma sedimentation documented in this study is rare in the Fennoscandian shield as a whole. Neocrystallization of authigenic illite in the ﬁnest 0.4 and {\textless} 0.1 µm fractions c. 809–697 Ma ago is interpreted as resulting from reactivation in the fault due to the continental break-up on the western side of the craton as documented by arenite crosscutting relationships. The younger ages may also be attributed to a Caledonian thermal overprint ca. 410 Ma ago that would inﬂuence the 967 Ma age if suﬃcient thermal energy had been present.},

@techreport{darcel_statistical_2009,
	title = {Statistical methodology for discrete fracture model – including fracture size, orientation uncertainty together with intensity uncertainty and variability},
	abstract = {Investigations led for several years at Laxemar and Forsmark reveal the large heterogeneity of geological
formations and associated fracturing. This project aims at reinforcing the statistical DFN modeling
framework adapted to a site scale. This leads therefore to develop quantitative methods of characterization
adapted to the nature of fracturing and data availability.
We start with the hypothesis that the maximum likelihood DFN model is a power-law model with a
density term depending on orientations. This is supported both by literature and specifically here by
former analyses of the SKB data. This assumption is nevertheless thoroughly tested by analyzing the
fracture trace and lineament maps.
Fracture traces range roughly between 0.5 m and 10 m – ie the usual extension of the sample outcrops.
Between the raw data and final data used to compute the fracture size distribution from which the size
distribution model will arise, several steps are necessary, in order to correct data from finite-size, topo-
graphical and sampling effects. More precisely, a particular attention is paid to fracture segmentation
status and fracture linkage consistent with the DFN model expected. The fracture scaling trend observed
over both sites displays finally a shape parameter kt close to 1.2 with a density term (α2d) between 1.4
and 1.8. Only two outcrops (ASM000205 and ASM000206) clearly display a different trend with kt
close to 3 and a density term (α2d) between 2 and 3.5.
The fracture lineaments spread over the range between 100 meters and a few kilometers. When compared
with fracture trace maps, these datasets are already interpreted and the linkage process developed previ-
ously has not to be done. Except for the subregional lineament map from Forsmark, lineaments display
a clear power-law trend with a shape parameter kt equal to 3 and a density term between 2 and 4.5.
The apparent variation in scaling exponent, from the outcrop scale (kt = 1.2) on one side, to the
lineament scale (kt = 2) on the other, addresses the issue of the nature of the transition. We develop
a new “mechanistic” model that could help in modeling why and where this transition can occur. The
transition between both regimes would occur for a fracture length of 1–10 m and even at a smaller
scale for the few outcrops that follow the self-similar density model. A consequence for the disposal
issue is that the model that is likely to apply in the “blind” scale window between 10–100 m is the self-
similar model as it is defined for large-scale lineaments. The self-similar model, as it is measured for
some outcrops and most lineament maps, is definitely worth being investigated as a reference for scales
above 1–10 m.
In the rest of the report, we develop a methodology for incorporating uncertainty and variability into
the DFN modeling. Fracturing properties arise from complex processes which produce an intrinsic
variability; characterizing this variability as an admissible variation of model parameter or as the
division of the site into subdomains with distinct DFN models is a critical point of the modeling
effort. Moreover, the DFN model encompasses a part of uncertainty, due to data inherent uncertainties
and sampling limits. Both effects must be quantified and incorporated into the DFN site model definition
process. In that context, all available borehole data including recording of fracture intercept positions,
pole orientation and relative uncertainties are used as the basis for the methodological development
and further site model assessment. An elementary dataset contains a set of discrete fracture intercepts
from which a parent orientation/density distribution can be computed. The elementary bricks of the
site, from which these initial parent density distributions are computed, rely on the former Single
Hole Interpretation division of the boreholes into sections whose local boundaries are expected to
reflect – locally – geology and fracturing properties main characteristics. From that starting point we
built Statistical Fracture Domains whose significance rely exclusively on fracturing statistics, not
including explicitly the current Fracture Domains or closeness between one borehole section or the other.
Theoretical developments are proposed in order to incorporate the orientation uncertainty and the
fracturing variability into a resulting parent distribution density uncertainty. When applied to both sites,
it comes that variability prevails in front of uncertainty, thus validating the good level of data accuracy.
Moreover, this allows to define a possible range of variation around the mean values of densities.
Finally a sorting algorithm is developed for providing, from the initial elementary bricks mentioned
above, a division of a site into Statistical Fracture Domains whose internal variability is reduced.
The systematic comparison is based on the division of the datasets according to several densities
referring to a division of the orientations into 13 subsets (pole zones). The first application of the
methodology shows that some main trends can be defined for the orientation/density distributions
throughout the site, which are combined with a high level of overlapping. Moreover the final Statistical
Fracture Domain definition differ from the Fracture Domains existing at the site. The SFD are an
objective comparison of statistical fracturing properties. Several perspectives are proposed in order
to bridge the gap between constraints brought by a relevant statistical modeling and modeling
specificities of the SKB sites and more generally conditions inherent to geological models},

	abstract = {Characterisation of fracture networks at different scales is challenging and important to many fields of geo­ science, especially when access to multiple resolution datasets is limited. Here, we develop an integrated analysis of fracture networks on carbonate platforms using three scales of observation: small (outcrop), intermediate (airborne LiDAR) and large (3D seismic). Statistical analyses and ternary diagrams of geometrical and topological data from Cariatiz (South East Spain) and Pernambuco (East Brazil) are used to understand the relationships and distribution of fracture networks between multi-scale datasets. A variety of fracture types at each scale of observation reveal how complex fracture networks are on carbonate platforms. Our results demonstrate that fracture network properties behave differently depending on the fracture size, and that transitional scale gaps between datasets constrain fracture characterisation. Airborne LiDAR maps show that intermediate-sized frac­ tures appear to have a better controlled orientation and a lower connectivity than smaller fractures from the same area in Cariatiz. Fracture branch length distributions fit a negative exponential or log-normal distribution for massive non-stratabound units. This work is important as it demonstrates that the use of outcrop data is a good approach to understand fracture complexity of carbonate platforms. Understanding sub-seismic fracture networks is therefore critical in quantifying fluid flow and permeability in carbonate reservoirs.},

Fractured rocks should therefore display an anisotropic permeability determined by the aperture, length, and orientation of those fractures remaining open. In this paper, a numerical study of this effect is made for a rock containing two orthogonal fracture sets subject to a uniaxial compressive stress applied perpendicular to one of the sets. With increasing compressive stress, the decreasing aperture of fractures orientated perpendicular to the stress axis leads to a decrease in permeability both parallel and perpendicular to the stress. For flow parallel to the stress direction, this is a consequence of the finite length of the fractures, flow in fractures perpendicular to the stress being required to connect fractures orientated parallel to the stress direction. As the number of fractures is decreased towards the percolation threshold, the average permeability tensor is found to become increasingly isotropic. This behaviour results from the highly tortuous nature of the flow paths just at the percolation threshold.},

We compare the metrics of the different nodes, branches, regions and components that make-up each damage zone fracture network, calculating parameters that assess their connectivity. Results identify distinct topological signatures and graph metrics for different tip-, relay- and splay-damage zones, providing a new classification that describes and quantifies their arrangement and connectivity. Placing the studied damage zones in a fault evolutionary model highlights topological pathways whereby tip-damage zones, dominated by Inodes and II-branches, give way to relay-damage zones, dominated by Y-nodes and CC-branches. During this process, tree-like components link to form larger interconnected components with many regions. This systematically changes the graph metrics of the network increasing the number of branches and regions relative to nodes and components. The topological pathways and graph metrics provide important insights into how damages zones might develop as faults propagate, interact and link and could have implications when assessing their importance for fluid-flow.},

              A multiple interacting continua (MINC) method is presented, which is applicable for numerical simulation presented, which is applicable for numerical simulation of heat and multiphase fluid flow in multidimensional, fractured porous media. This method is a generalization of the double-porosity concept. The partitioning of the flow domain into computational volume elements is based on the criterion of approximate thermodynamic equilibrium at all times within each element. The thermodynamic conditions in the rock matrix are assumed to be controlled primarily by the distance from the fractures, which leads to the use of nested gridblocks. The MINC concept is implemented through the integral finite difference (IFD) method. No analytical approximations are made for coupling between the fracture and matrix continua. Instead, the transient flow of fluid and heat between matrix and fractures is treated by a numerical method. The geometric parameters needed in simulation are preprocessed from a specification of fracture spacings and apertures and geometry of the matrix blocks.
              The numerical implementation of the MINC method is verified by comparison with the analytical solution of Warren and Root. Illustrative applications are given for several geothermal reservoir engineering problems.
              
                Introduction
                In this paper, we present a numerical method for simulating transient nonisothermal, two-phase flow of water in fractured porous medium. The method is base on a generalization of a concept originally proposed by Barenblatt et al. and introduced into the petroleum literature by Warren and Root, Odeh, and others in the form of what has been termed the "double-porosity" model. The essence of this approach is that in a fractured porous medium, fractures are characterized by much porous medium, fractures are characterized by much larger diffusivities (and hence, much smaller response times) than the rock matrix. Therefore, the early system response is influenced by the matrix. In seeking to analytically solve such a system, all fractures were grouped into one continuum and all the matrix blocks into another, resulting in two interacting continua coupled through a mass transfer function determined by the size and shape of the blocks, as well as the local difference in potentials between the two continua. Later, Kazemi and Duguid and Lee incorporated the double-porosity concept into a numerical model. For a more detailed description of the concept and its application, see Refs. 6 through 8.
                Very little work has been done in investigating nonisothermal, two-phase fluid flow in fractured porous media. Moench and coworkers used the discrete fracture approach to study the behavior of fissured, vapor-dominated geothermal reservoirs. The purpose of our work is first to generalize the double-porosity concept into one of many interacting continua. We then incorporate the MINC model into a simulator for nonisothermal transport of a homogeneous two-phase fluid (water and steam) in multidimensional systems. Our approach is considerably broader in scope and more general than any previous models discussed in the literature. The MINC previous models discussed in the literature. The MINC method permits treatment of multiphase fluids with large and variable compressibility and allows for phase transitions with latent heat effects, as well as for coupling between fluid and heat flow. The transient interaction between matrix and fractures is treated in a realistic way. Although the model can permit alternative formulations for the equation of motion, we shall assume that, macroscopically, each continuum obeys Darcy's law; in particular, we shall use the "cubic law" for the flow of particular, we shall use the "cubic law" for the flow of fluids in fracture. While the methodology presented in this paper is generally applicable to multiphase compositional thermal systems, our illustrative calculations were restricted to geothermal reservoir problems.
                The numerical method chosen to implement the MINC concept is the IFD method. In this method, all thermophysical and thermodynamic properties are represented by averages over explicitly defined finite subdomains, while fluxes of mass or energy across surface segments are evaluated through finite difference approximations. An important aspect of this method is that the geometric quantities required to evaluate the conductance between two communicating volume elements are provided directly as input data rather than having them generated from data on nodal arrangements and nodal coordinates. Thus, a remarkable flexibility is attained by which one can allow a volume element in any one continuum to communicate with another element in its own or any other continuum. Inasmuch as the interaction between volume elements of different continua is handled as a geometric feature, the IFD methodology does not distinguish between the MINC method and the conventional porous-medium type approaches to modeling. porous-medium type approaches to modeling.

	abstract = {To investigate the inﬂuence of a tensile stress gradient on fracture initiation and fracture growth in rock material, a conﬁguration, consisting of a diametrically loaded disc with a hole on the diameter perpendicular to the loaded diameter, is used. The maximum local tensile stresses the material is able to withstand increase as the stress gradient increases. Depending on the diameter and the eccentricity of the hole, the disc splits along the loaded diameter or macro-fracturing starts at the hole. However, the tensile stresses at the top and the bottom of the hole are for nearly all cases considerably higher than the stress along the loaded diameter and than the macroscopic tensile strength of the material, determined by conventional Brazilian tests. To better understand this particular fracturing behaviour, numerical simulations of the experiments are conducted using the boundary element code DIGS, which allows the incorporation of weak elements (ﬂaws), representing defects and weaknesses in the rock material. It is shown that the inﬂuence of the stress gradient on the stress concentration at the tip of mobilised defects lies at the origin of the particular fracturing behaviour in the diametrically loaded disc with a hole. The study of the new conﬁguration leads also to a number of conclusions with regard to the failure in diametrically loaded discs in general. Based on the ﬂaw model, fracture initiation in the Brazilian test has to be attributed to fracture growth of a mobilised defect, situated in the area close to one of the platens.},

	abstract = {The earliest Svecofennian magmatism in southern Finland has been dated to 1.90-1.88Ga. As an example of this, the Orijärvi (ca. 1.89Ga) and Enklinge (ca. 1.88Ga) volcanic centres comprise bimodal plutonic batholiths surrounded by volcanic rocks of comparable ages and chemical compositions. The rock types range from gabbros to granites and indicate a subduction-related continental margin setting. The zircons from the Orijärvi granodiorite define an age of 1892±4Ma whereas the Enklinge granodiorite yields an age of 1882±6Ma. Several inherited ages of 2.25-1.95Ga as well as younger metamorphic ages of 1.86-1.80Ga were found in the Enklinge granodiorite. The initial εNd values of the mafic rocks from both locations fall in the range +1.1 to +2.9, whereas the felsic rocks exhibit initial εNd values of -0.4 to +1.2. The magmatic zircons from the Orijärvi and Enklinge granodiorites show average initial εHf values of -1.1 (at 1892Ma) and zero (at 1882Ma), respectively, both with a spread of about 7 ε-units. The initial εHf values for the inherited zircons from Enklinge range from +3.5 to +7.6 with increasing age. The Sm-Nd data indicate that the mafic rocks were derived from a “mildly depleted” mantle source while the felsic rocks show some crustal contribution. Also, the variation in εHf values indicates minor mixing between mildly depleted mantle-derived magmas and crustal sources. U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes for inherited zircons from the Enklinge granodiorite suggest the presence of juvenile Svecofennian “proto-crust” at depth.},

Optimal characterisation and analysis of fracture lengths and apertures are fundamental to estimate bulk permeability and therefore ﬂuid ﬂow, especially for rocks with low primary porosity where most of the ﬂow takes place within fractures. We collected outcrop data from a fractured upper Miocene biosiliceous mudstone formation (California, USA), which exhibits seepage of bitumen-rich ﬂuids through the fractures. The dataset was analysed using Maximum Likelihood Estimators to extract the underlying scaling parameters, and we found a lognormal distribution to be the best representative statistic for both fracture lengths and apertures in the study area. By applying Maximum Likelihood Estimators on outcrop fracture data, we generate fracture network models with the same statistical attributes to the ones observed on outcrop, from which we can achieve more robust predictions of bulk permeability.},

The Bodom pluton is composed of porphyritic granites (hornblende-, hornblende-biotite-, and biotite-bearing varieties) and an evengrained granite that probably represent two separate intrusive phases. This lithologic variation does not occur in the Obbnäs pluton, which is almost entirely composed of porphyritic hornblende-biotite granite that gradually becomes more mafic to the southwest. Three types of hybrid granitoids resulting from magma mingling and mixing occur on the southwestern tip of the Obbnäs peninsula. The Bodom granites are syenogranites, whereas the composition of the Obbnäs granite varies from syeno- to monzogranite. The main silicates of both the Bodom and Obbnäs granites are quartz, microcline, plagioclase (An1541), biotite (siderophyllite), and generally also amphibole (ferropargasite or hastingsite). Plagioclase-mantled alkali feldspar megacrysts are absent or rare. The accessory minerals are fluorite, allanite, zircon, apatite, and iron-titanium oxides; the Obbnäs granite also contains titanite. The Bodom and Obbnäs granites are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, with average A/CNK of 1.00 and 1.05, respectively, have high Fe/Mg (average FeOtot/[FeOtot+MgO] is 0.94 for the Bodom and 0.87 for the Obbnäs granites), and high Ga/Al (3.78 to 5.22 in Bodom and 2.46 to 4.18 in Obbnäs). The REE contents are high with LREE-enriched chondrite-normalized patterns and moderate (Obbnäs) to relatively strong (Bodom) negative Eu-anomalies. The Obbnäs granite is enriched in CaO, TiOz, MgO, and FeO, and depleted in Si02 and K 2 0 compared to the Bodom granites. Also, there are differences in the Ba, Rb, and Sr contents of the two plutons (Ba and Sr higher, Rb lower in Obbnäs) that cannot easily be traced to single parental granite magma. These features, together with the presence of titanite in the Obbnäs pluton, suggest different sources for the granites of the two plutons: a potassium feldspar-rich source for Bodom and potassium feldspar-poor for Obbnäs.},

scale. We propose that the simplest model is a power law in both space and fracture length,
with three main parameters: the exponent a of a power law length distribution, the
fractal dimension D which fixes the scale dependence of the number of fractures, and the
fracture density a. We verify the applicability of this model on seven fracture patterns
mapped from the metric scale up to almost the kilometric scale in the Hornelen basin. The
model efficiently describes fracture network properties at all scales with a single set of
parameters. For the Hornelen fracture networks we found a simple relationship between
basic exponents, a = D + 1, implying that the fracture network is self-similar. Through this
analysis, we present different methodological developments for deriving the basic
exponents a and D and for verifying the consistency of the model. Overall, the main
methodological development is about the normalization of the measurements made from
different scales of observation. Finally, we discuss both the limitations and the uses of
such a model for analyzing the hydraulic and mechanical properties of fracture

Summary in English. The Perapohja area is one part of the Lapland Volcanite Project of the Geological Survey of Finland. The study is mainly based o n material collected during the mapping activities between 1963-1983. The bedrock of the Perapohja area is composed of three major geological units -the area of mostly Archaean Pudasjärvi Granite Gneiss Complex, the early Proterozoic Perapohja Schist Belt, and the area of younger plutonic rocks of early Proterozoic age. The Granite Gneiss Complex contains small inclusion-like areas of amphibolite and amphibole gneiss of probable volcanic origin. The Perapohja Schist Belt contains three volcanic formations (the Runkaus, Jouttiaapa and Tikanmaa formations) separated by quartzitic sedimentary formations. The basalts of the Runkaus Volcanic Formation are lowermost in the sequence and are tholeiites with relatively evolved compositions. The first lava flow has a moderate enrichment of LRE and other incompatible trace elements whereas the next flow shows a pronounced enrichment. The differences are due to a magrnatic history which includes fractionation and crustal contamination. The basalts of the overlying Jouttiaapa Volcanic Formation are tholeiites depleted in immobile incompatible trace elements. The lower part of the formation is strongly depleted in LREE. The lavas of the upper part are moderately depleted. The Jouttiaapa lavas represent fractionated and uncontaminated magmas from a strongly depleted mantle. The uppermost volcanic formation, the Tikanmaa Formation, is composed of tuffitic rocks. Geochemically, they resemble the volcanics of the Jouttiaapa Formation. Due to the mixed sedimentary material, the range of the chemical analyses is greater than in the other two volcanic formations. The differentiated mafic sills which have penetrated into the quartzite between the two lowermost volcanic formations have an enriched LREE pattern. These igneous rocks are not genetically connected with any of the overlying volcanic formations. The lavas of the Runkaus Volcanic Formation erupted in a cratonic environment at the beginning of the rifting. The upper volcanic formations have distinct MORB affinities. The general geologic setting suggests, however, a rift-controlled continental margin environment for the volcanism.},

Fracture clustering data can be used in conjunction with the spatial distributions to provide information on the controlling processes of fracture spacing. We suggest that exponential spacing distribution is produced as a sampling effect for both periodic-spaced and clustered fracture sets. In the examples given here, thermal stress-related joint patterns are distinguishable from tectonic-related fractures in plutonic rocks and fracture density and clustering is increased towards a major reactivated basement fault.},

If such a relationship does exist, then probably it cannot be accounted for by sampling bias alone.

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The area of this study is one of the important places in Malaysia, which contains many ore deposits, plantation fields, landslides, and villages. Because of this, study of geological structures (lineaments) is one of the most important factors, which gives indications about the locations of ore deposits, landslides, and groundwater movements. Shaded relief images created from digital elevation models (DEMs) are helpful in identifying lineaments in different distinct relief and topography. The method can enhance lineaments at different orientations by simulating topographic illumination under varied light directions. Combining four shaded relief images into a final image leads to enhancing lineaments within the four sun azimuth directions. Two shaded relief images with multi-directional light were created, the first image with the four azimuth angles of the light sources that are 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°, and the second image with the four azimuth angles of the light sources that are 180°, 225°, 270°,and 315°. Both images have been used for automatic lineament extraction using PCI Geomatica software. The extracted lineaments of the first image show that the most automatic lineaments represent positive lineaments; and the automatic lineaments of second image represent negative lineaments of the study area. The directional analysis of the automatically extracted lineament maps have been done with the reference of the fault map of the area. The results verify the similarity in the directional behaviour of the lineaments, the fault lines and the structures measured in the field. The main trends of the extracted lineaments of both images are NW-SE, N-S, E-W and NE-SW.},

	abstract = {The characterisation of natural fracture networks using outcrop analogues is important in understanding subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and rock mass characteristics in fractured lithologies. It is well known from decision sciences that subjective bias can signiﬁcantly impact the way data are gathered and interpreted, introducing scientiﬁc uncertainty. This study investigates the scale and nature of subjective bias on fracture data collected using four commonly applied approaches (linear scanlines, circular scanlines, topology sampling, and window sampling) both in the ﬁeld and in workshops using ﬁeld photographs. We demonstrate that geologists’ own subjective biases inﬂuence the data they collect, and, as a result, different participants collect different fracture data from the same scanline or sample area. As a result, the fracture statistics that are derived from ﬁeld data can vary considerably for the same scanline, depending on which geologist collected the data. Additionally, the personal bias of geologists collecting the data affects the scanline size (minimum length of linear scanlines, radius of circular scanlines, or area of a window sample) needed to collect a statistically representative amount of data. Fracture statistics derived from ﬁeld data are often input into geological models that are used for a range of applications, from understanding ﬂuid ﬂow to characterising rock strength. We suggest protocols to recognise, understand, and limit the effect of subjective bias on fracture data biases during data collection. Our work shows the capacity for cognitive biases to introduce uncertainty into observation-based data and has implications well beyond the geosciences.},

This paper explores the application of Q and its six component parameters, for prediction, correlation and extrapolation of site investigation data, and for obtaining ﬁrst estimates of some input data for both jointed distinct element and continuum-approximation modelling. Parameters explored here include P-wave velocity, static modulus of deformation, support pressure, tunnel deformation, Lugeon-value, and the possible cohesive and frictional strength of rock masses, undisturbed, or as affected by underground excavation. The effect of depth or stress level, and anisotropic strength, structure and stress are each addressed, and practical solutions suggested. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the potential improvements in rock mass properties and reduced support needs that can be expected from state-ofthe-art pre-injection with ﬁne, cementicious multi-grouts, based on measurements of permeability tensor principal value rotations and reductions, caused by grout penetration of the least favourable joint sets. Several slightly improved Q-parameter ratings form the basis of the predicted improvements in general rock mass properties that can be achieved by pre-grouting. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper presents the development and use of our new DigiFract software designed for acquiring fracture data from outcrops more efﬁciently and more completely than done with other methods. Fracture surveys often aim at measuring spatial information (such as spacing) directly in the ﬁeld. Instead, DigiFract focuses on collecting geometries and attributes and derives spatial information through subsequent analyses. Our primary development goal was to support ﬁeld acquisition in a systematic digital format and optimized for a varied range of (spatial) analyses. DigiFract is developed using the programming interface of the Quantum Geographic Information System (GIS) with versatile functionality for spatial raster and vector data handling. Among other features, this includes spatial referencing of outcrop photos, and tools for digitizing geometries and assigning attribute information through a graphical user interface. While a GIS typically operates in map-view, DigiFract collects features on a surface of arbitrary orientation in 3D space. This surface is overlain with an outcrop photo and serves as reference frame for digitizing geologic features. Data is managed through a data model and stored in shapeﬁles or in a spatial database system. Fracture attributes, such as spacing or length, is intrinsic information of the digitized geometry and becomes explicit through follow-up data processing. Orientation statistics, scan-line or scan-window analyses can be performed from the graphical user interface or can be obtained through ﬂexible Python scripts that directly access the fractdatamodel and analysisLib core modules of DigiFract. This workﬂow has been applied in various studies and enabled a faster collection of larger and more accurate fracture datasets. The studies delivered a better characterization of fractured reservoirs analogues in terms of fracture orientation and intensity distributions. Furthermore, the data organisation and analyses provided more independent constraints on the bed-conﬁned or through-going nature of fractures relative to the stratigraphic layering.},

Tamariu granite has been the subject of this study with the aim to analyse faults and fractures from seismic to borehole scale. With the combination of satellite picture at different resolution and ﬁeld study, we perform a statistical analysis focused of the length and orientation from infra centimeter crack to hundred kilometer length fault. On the whole range of scale studied, i.e. on 7 orders of magnitude, we have deﬁned a length distribution following a power-law with an exponent a ¼ À2. On the contrary to the length that can be modelled with a unique law, the orientation data shows a variation depending on the scale of observation: as the fault and fracture sets are suitable from the regional faults to the centimeter crack, the proportion of the sets varies at each scale of observation.},

	abstract = {Groundwater–surface water interactions were studied in a Finnish esker aquifer system where some lakes suffer from periodic water level decline and others from eutrophication. Natural tracers (Ca2+, SiO2 and PO34À) were used on the aquifer scale and seepage meter measurements and water level recordings on the single lake scale to better understand the complex interactions between groundwater, lakes and streams in the area. The natural tracers showed that lakes located in lower landscape positions and connected with streams were richer in tracer concentrations and that their water chemistry resembled that of the groundwater. On the other hand, closed basin lakes located at higher altitudes were nutrient-poor seepage lakes with some groundwater through ﬂow. The data suggests that the subsurface acts as a phosphate source for the surface water bodies and the nutrient rich groundwater inseepage dictates the trophic status of the lakes in the area. The seepage meter measurements veriﬁed a strong interaction between groundwater and surface water and revealed spatial distribution of lake seepage and a temporal co-variation in lake seepage rates. A statistical analysis of seepage meter and water level observation time series were useful to show groundwater ﬂow regimes controlling lake seepage. Using the natural tracer analysis and seepage meter measurements, we developed a novel conceptual model for the study site where the differences in lake trophic state and water table behavior were explained by assigning lakes to local and regional groundwater ﬂow regimes. The obtained results provide new knowledge on using natural tracers in complex glacial aquifer systems and can be used in integrated groundwater–surface water management.},

These analyses rely on quantifying such factors as length, frequency and connectivity. Measurements may, however, be influenced by a range of factors relating to resolution, geology, methods used and to the analyst(s). These factors mean that it can be difficult to obtain a single correct solution, with bias and uncertainty being introduced by different analysts, even for something as simple as counting the number of joint intersection points on a well-exposed bedding plane. These problems suggest there are significant issues in comparing databases, for example when using outcrop analogue data to model subsurface data. Our recommendation is that analysts and modellers should be aware of the potential pitfalls in their measurements of structures and, therefore, be more cautious with resultant analyses and models. We suggest that analysts assess their results by testing the reproducibility. Simple ways of doing this include: (1) checking for change in measurements (e.g., fracture frequencies) during the course of a study; (2) remeasuring part of the fracture network to check if the same results are obtained, and; (3) get one or more other analysts to blind-test the fracture network.},

	abstract = {The Siilinjärvi carbonatite complex is named after the nearby village of Siilinjärvi, located some 5 km west of the southern extension of the complex. It is one of the oldest carbonatites on Earth, and the oldest presently being mined. Due to its age, it has been metamorphosed, particularly during the 1.8 Ga Svecofennian event, and intruded by several generations of younger, mafic to intermediate dikes, and a tonalite-diorite intrusion. Despite this overprint, the bulk of the rocks of the complex show well-preserved igneous textures, primary magmatic compositions of constituent minerals, and retain most of their primary isotopic compositions, which point to a mantle derivation. As such, the carbonatite and associated rocks provide a rare opportunity to constrain the mineralogy and geochemistry of the Archean mantle. Dominant rock types in the complex include carbonatite, silicocarbonatite, carbonatite-glimmerite, and glimmerite (mainly tetraferriphlogopite) within the main intrusion, all of which are surrounded by a halo of metasomatically produced fenites. Primary magmatic saline aqueous fluids rich in alkali elements have been identified in fluid inclusions in zircon and apatite from the carbonatite, explaining the formation of the well-developed metasomatic fenite syenite halo. Mining for apatite as a source for phosphorus began in 1979 by Kemira Oy, but since 2007 the deposit has been under the ownership of Yara International ASA, presently producing about 11 Mt of ore per year combined from the main Särkijärvi pit in the south, and the satellite Saarinen pit in the north.},

Existing methods in this ﬁeld usually compute fracture connectivity using the average fracture length. This approach is valid for ideally shaped, randomly distributed fractures, but is not immediately applicable to natural fracture networks. In particular, natural networks tend to be more connected than randomly positioned fractures of comparable lengths, since natural fractures often terminate in each other. The proposed topological connectivity measure is based on the number of intersections and fracture terminations per sampling area, which for statistically stationary networks can be obtained directly from limited outcrop exposures. To evaluate the method, numerical permeability upscaling was performed on a large number of synthetic and natural fracture networks, with varying topology and geometry. The proposed method was seen to provide much more reliable permeability estimates than the length-based approach, across a wide range of fracture patterns. We summarize our results in a single, explicit formula for the effective permeability.},

	abstract = {The influence that fractures exert on the permeability of a fractured rock is, to a large extent, controlled by the nature of the network formed by the fracture system. Here, the network properties of a two-dimensional natural pattern, mapped from the surface of a sandstone layer, are investigated and compared to those of realizations of spatially randomly distributed line segments with similar orientation and length distributions and line segment density (line length per unit area) to the natural pattern. These patterns are composed of clusters of varying size and shape, made up of interconnected fracture traces or line segments. Comparing the natural pattern with the realizations, the natural pattern was found to contain roughly half the number of clusters while the mass (total line length) of the largest cluster is approximately double that of the realizations. The size of the largest cluster controls the connectivity of the patterns, as can be seen by comparing the largest cluster of the natural pattern, which connects all four sides of the region, with those of the realizations, which are unconnected or connect only two sides. Cluster scaling characteristics were found to be similar in the natural pattern and the realizations and show a crossover from a dimension of one (their topological dimension) to two (the dimension of the embedding medium) at a point that corresponds to the fracture spacing. An investigation of the self-similarity dimension, using the box-counting method, showed similar characteristics with a broad transition zone between one- and two-dimensional behaviour at smaller box sizes. The patterns are therefore found to be non-fractal. The effect of the spatial distribution shown by the natural pattern is thus to modify the manner in which fractures are distributed among clusters, increasing connectivity (and permeability in the case of open fractures), but does not affect the cluster scaling characteristics or the self-similarity dimension of the fracture patterns.},

	abstract = {Topological analysis of networks of linear features has recently gained popularity in structural geology, as it provides a robust system of fracture network characterisation with consistent terminology. This approach has mainly been applied by using discontinuous sample areas to characterise topology of a region, or geological feature (e.g. Procter and Sanderson, 2018). We apply network topology to investigate spatial variation of a natural fracture network in the damage zone of the Castle Cove Fault, Otway Basin, Victoria. The Castle Cove Fault’s associated fracture network occurs in the hanging-wall Eumeralla Formation, a fine-to medium-grained volcanogenic sandstone or Early Cretaceous age. Topological characterisation of the Castle Cove Fault damagezone identified an increase in the two-dimensional intensity of fracturing in the hanging-wall at a distance 70 m from the fault, reaching a maximum {\textasciitilde}40 m from the fault, indicating the extent of the fault-damage zone is between 40 and 70 m from the main fault. Maximum fracture intensity values decay with a power law rela­ tionship with respect to distance from the fault plane, averaging {\textasciitilde}0.06 adjacent to the fault, and {\textasciitilde}0.02 within what is interpreted as the regional fracture network, 70 m + outboard of the fault. Fracture orientations in the damage zone are synthetic and antithetic with respect to the {\textasciitilde}60◦ dip to the NW of the of the Castle Cove Fault, with these fault-related fractures overprinting an existing regional fracture network, creating high fracture network connectivity within the fault-damage zone. Our results show that network topology is a powerful tool for quantifying and visualising the properties of fracture networks associated with crustal-scale faults.},

	abstract = {Deformation along faults in the shallow crust (b 1 km) introduces permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy, which has an important impact on processes such as regional groundwater ﬂow, hydrocarbon migration, and hydrothermal ﬂuid circulation. Fault zones have the capacity to be hydraulic conduits connecting shallow and deep geological environments, but simultaneously the fault cores of many faults often form effective barriers to ﬂow. The direct evaluation of the impact of faults to ﬂuid ﬂow patterns remains a challenge and requires a multidisciplinary research effort of structural geologists and hydrogeologists. However, we ﬁnd that these disciplines often use different methods with little interaction between them. In this review, we document the current multidisciplinary understanding of fault zone hydrogeology. We discuss surface- and subsurface observations from diverse rock types from unlithiﬁed and lithiﬁed clastic sediments through to carbonate, crystalline, and volcanic rocks. For each rock type, we evaluate geological deformation mechanisms, hydrogeologic observations and conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Outcrop observations indicate that fault zones commonly have a permeability structure suggesting they should act as complex conduit–barrier systems in which along-fault ﬂow is encouraged and across-fault ﬂow is impeded. Hydrogeological observations of fault zones reported in the literature show a broad qualitative agreement with outcrop-based conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Nevertheless, the speciﬁc impact of a particular fault permeability structure on fault zone hydrogeology can only be assessed when the hydrogeological context of the fault zone is considered and not from outcrop observations alone. To gain a more integrated, comprehensive understanding of fault zone hydrogeology, we foresee numerous synergistic opportunities and challenges for the discipline of structural geology and hydrogeology to co-evolve and address remaining challenges by co-locating study areas, sharing approaches and fusing data, developing conceptual models from hydrogeologic data, numerical modeling, and training interdisciplinary scientists.},

Consequently, they usually cannot produce results unless a considerable body of empirical information has been collected, or unless the analyst is willing to make several assumptions in the place of such empirical information. (2) Although appropriate for handling variability and stochasticity, Monte Carlo methods cannot be used to propagate partial ignorance under any frequentist interpretation of probability. (3) Monte Carlo methods cannot be used to conclude that exceedance risks are no larger than a particular level. (4) Finally, Monte Carlo methods cannot be used to effect deconvolutions to solve backcalculation problems such as often arise in remediation planning.

Furthermore, SOM was able to identify and enhance very subtle signatures derived jointly from the magnetic and gamma ray spectrometric data that could be related to geologic processes present in the area.

Factors influencing channel location, morphology, and sediment deposition are ice flow direction and the Precambrian bedrock topography, in turn dependent upon bedrock structure and composition. Meltwater drainage across the Frontenac Arch is localized within a broad depression oriented approximately parallel to glacial flow. Sediment deposition within the regional depression follows ice-flow direction despite irregular bedrock relief, indicating formation of the meltwater system and associated sediments in three stages: (i) establishment of a continuous meltwater system subglacially under high hydrostatic pressure with minor erosion of underlying Precambrian bedrock; (ii) deposition of poorly sorted, coarse-grained sediment in cavities or channels associated with irregular bedrock topography; and (iii) deposition of several coalescing subaqueous outwash fans at the ice margin as the glacier receded from the area. The discontinuous nature of the deposits and the association of proximal to distal outwash fan facies within a deposit suggest that esker sedimentation occurred during periodic stabilization of the ice front during deglaciation.},

Data were collected from coastal outcrops and well core across the Windsor-Kennetcook subbasin, a subbasin in the Maritimes Basin, using the circular scan-line and vertical scan-line methods in outcrop, and FMI Image log analysis of core. We use cross-cutting and abutting relationships between fractures to understand relative timing of fracturing, followed by a statistical test (Markov chain analysis) to separate groups of fractures. This analysis, previously used in sedimentology, was modiﬁed to statistically test the randomness of fracture timing relationships. The results of the Markov chain analysis suggest that fracture initiation can be attributed to movement along the Minas Fault Zone, an E-W fault system that bounds the Windsor-Kennetcook subbasin to the north. Four sets of fractures are related to dextral strike slip along the Minas Fault Zone in the late Paleozoic, and four sets are related to sinistral reactivation of the same boundary in the Mesozoic.},

	abstract = {Fracture intensity, the number of fractures per unit length along a sample line, is an important attribute of fracture systems that can be problematic to establish in the subsurface. Lack of adequate constraints on fracture intensity may limit the economic exploitation of fractured reservoirs because intensity describes the abundance of fractures potentially available for fluid flow and the probability of encountering fractures in a borehole. Traditional methods of fracture-intensity measurement are inadequate because they ignore the wide spectrum of fracture sizes found in many fracture systems and the consequent scale dependence of fracture intensity. An alternative approach makes use of fracture-size distributions, which allow more meaningful comparisons between different locations and allow microfractures in subsurface samples to be used for fracture-intensity measurement. Comparisons are more meaningful because sampling artifacts can be recognized and avoided, and because common thresholds of fracture size can be enforced for counting in different locations. Additionally, quantification of the fracture-size distribution provides a mechanism for evaluation of uncertainties. Estimates of fracture intensity using this approach for two carbonate beds in the Sierra Madre Oriental, Mexico, illustrate how size-cognizant measurements cast new light on widely accepted interpretation of geologic controls of fracture intensity.},

Curvature is one of many, indirect, fracture-inferring attributes. It does not detect fractures, but is causally related to them through the assumption that increasing curvature relates to increasing strain. There are many other variables that are causally related to fractures. We propose that it would be advantageous to create combinations of these causal variables with curvature. Some of the most well known and important causes of variations in natural fracture density are material properties relating to brittleness. Material properties are critical geologically at all scales, from large-scale regional studies to prospect-level inquiries because the properties may vary significantly within individual formations and between formations. These vertical and lateral changes in material properties may be important and should be considered in fracture estimation, along with curvature. There is a lack of clarity regarding exactly which material property is best from the perspective of physics and rock mechanics; however, we have chosen a combination of parameters that we argue is a starting point. Fortunately, material properties are routinely estimated with amplitude variation with offset (AVO) techniques, and there is little practical reason not to use them together with curvature to produce a more complete attribute inferring fracture density. The combination of these variables is a step in the direction of creating quantitative causal fracture prediction estimates.},

Orientation and density can be determined with some degree of accuracy but the uncertainty ranges associated with the other characteristics will be large. Calibration with dynamic indicators will bring out the hydraulic properties of the network and can help to reduce uncertainty in the geometric characteristics. The fracture network geometry in the interwell space can be described through geostatistical analysis but more commonly it is derived from seismic data, through edge detection or the analysis and calibration of seismic velocity anisotropy attributes or curvature analysis. Geomechanical analysis is necessary to evaluate the impact on network conductivity of the changing stress state in the reservoir. Using percolation theory, a qualitative assessment can be made of how the conductivity and interconnectedness of the fracture network is developed in terms of network clusters. This integrated analysis of static and dynamic fracture data leads to the formulation of conceptual models and a set of modelling rules. A Digital (Discrete) Fracture Network model, based on these concept(s), rules and interwell interpolation data, can then be analysed in terms of expected network cluster size, distribution and hydraulics. This provides a control on the expectations embedded in the concepts prior to dynamic modelling. The uncertainties are normally quite large and very seldom will they allow construction of the deﬁnitive fracture model. The systematic and integrated analysis of fracture network geometry, constrained with dynamic indicators and subsequent network cluster analysis, are necessary preparatory steps for construction and analysis of dynamic models.},

	abstract = {In the basement fractured reservoirs, geometric parameters of fractures constitute the main properties for modeling and prediction of reservoir behavior and then ﬂuid ﬂow. This study aims to propose geometric description and quantify the multiscale network organization and its effect on connectivity using a wide-ranging scale analysis and orders scale classiﬁcation. This work takes place in the Noble Hills (NH) range, located in the Death Valley (DV, USA). The statistical analyses were performed from regional maps to thin sections. The combination of the length datasets has led to compute a power law exponent around −2, meaning that the connectivity is ruled by the small and the large fractures. Three domains have been highlighted in the NH: (1) domain A is characterized by a dominance of the NW/SE direction at the fourth order scale; (2) domain B is characterized by a dominance of the E/W and the NW/SE directions at respectively the fourth and third order scales; (3) domain C is also marked by the E/W direction dominance followed by the NW/SE direction respectively at the fourth and third order scale. The numerical simulations should consider that the orientation depends on scale observation, while the length is independent of scale observation.},

	abstract = {Rapidly growing topic, the discrete fracture network engineering (DFNE), has already attracted many talents from diverse disciplines in academia and industry around the world to challenge diﬃcult problems related to mining, geothermal, civil, oil and gas, water and many other projects. Although, there are few commercial software capable of providing some useful functionalities fundamental for DFNE, their costs, closed code (black box) distributions and hence limited programmability and tractability encouraged us to respond to this rising demand with a new solution. This paper introduces an open source comprehensive software package for stochastic modeling of fracture networks in two- and three-dimension in discrete formulation. Functionalities included are geometric modeling (e.g., complex polygonal fracture faces, and utilizing directional statistics), simulations, characterizations (e.g., intersection, clustering and connectivity analyses) and applications (e.g., ﬂuid ﬂow). The package is completely written in Matlab scripting language. Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been made to bring maximum ﬂexibility to the functions in order to solve problems in both two- and three-dimensions in an easy and united way that is suitable for beginners, advanced and experienced users.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of fracture networks on rock mass properties is an essential part of a wide range of applications in geosciences from understanding permeability of groundwater aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs to erodibility properties and slope stability of rock masses for geotechnical engineering. However, gathering high-quality, oriented-fracture datasets in the ﬁeld can be difﬁcult and time-consuming, for example, due to constraints on ﬁeld work time or access (e.g. cliffs). Therefore, a method for obtaining accurate, quantitative fracture data from photographs is a signiﬁcant beneﬁt. In this paper we describe a method for generating a series of digital fracture traces in a geographic information system (GIS) environment, in which spatial analysis of a fracture network can be carried out. The method is not meant to replace the gathering of data in the ﬁeld but to be used in conjunction with it, and it is well suited when ﬁeld work time is limited or when the section cannot be accessed directly. The basis of the method is the generation of the vector dataset (shapeﬁle) of a fracture network from a georeferenced photograph of an outcrop in a GIS environment. From that shapeﬁle, key parameters such as fracture density and orientation can be calculated. Furthermore, in the GIS environment more complex spatial calculations and graphical plots can be carried out such as heat maps of fracture density. Advantages and limitations compared to other fracture network capture methods are discussed.},

	abstract = {Examples are presented of three temporal relationships between joints and faults: joints that pre-date faults; joints that are precursors to, or synchronous with, faults; and joints that post-date faults. Emphasis is placed on strike-slip faults in carbonate beds, but other examples are used. General rules are given for identifying the three temporal relationships between joints and faults. Joints that formed before faults can be dilated, sheared or affected by pressure solution during faulting, depending on their orientation in relation to the applied stress system. Faulted joints can preserve some original geometry of a joint pattern, with pinnate joints or veins commonly developing where faulted joints interact. Joints formed synchronously with faults re¯ect the same stress system that caused the faulting, and tend to increase in frequency toward faults. In contrast, joints that pre- or post-date faults tend not to increase in frequency towards the fault. Joints that post-date a fault may cut across or abut the fault and fault-related veins, without being displaced by the fault. They may also lack dilation near the fault, even if the fault has associated veins. Joints formed either syn- or post-faulting may curve into the fault, indicating stress perturbation around the fault. Different joint patterns may exist across the fault because of mechanical variations. Geometric features may therefore be used in the ®eld to identify the temporal relationships between faults and joints, especially where early joints affect or control fault development, or where the distribution of late joints are in¯uenced by faults. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Orthogonal cross joints extend across intervals between systematic joints in brittle sedimentary strata and abut the systematic joints at about 908 angles. These joints typically form a `ladder-like' pattern if viewed on a bedding surface. A common interpretation is that orthogonal cross joints de®ne the orientation of the regional stress ®eld during their formation: least compressive stress perpendicular to the joints. It follows that they indicate a rotation of regional principal stresses by 908 after the formation of the systematic joints. Using a three-dimensional boundary element code (Poly3D), we considered a simple geologic case of vertical systematic fractures developing in horizontal strata under a triaxial remote load with: the maximum principal tensile stress being horizontal and perpendicular to the strike of the fractures, the intermediate principal stress being horizontal and parallel to the strike of the fractures, and the least principal tensile stress (i.e. maximum compressive stress) being vertical. The results show that the local maximum principal stress is ®rst perpendicular, and then parallel to, the strike of the systematic fractures as the ratio of fracture spacing to height changes from greater than to less than a critical value when the horizontal remote principal stress ratio, the ratio of the intermediate remote principal stress to the maximum remote principal stress under the sign convention of positive for tensile stresses, is greater than a threshold value (,0.2). Thus, the fracturing process changes from in®lling of systematic fractures to the formation of orthogonal cross fractures. This provides an alternative mechanism for the formation of orthogonal cross joints that does not require a systematic rotation of the regional stress ®eld by 908. The critical spacing to height ratio for the local principal stress switch is independent of the least remote principal stress (i.e. overburden). It increases nonlinearly with increasing ratio of the horizontal remote principal stresses, and decreases nonlinearly with increasing Poisson's ratio of the material. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main aim of this study was to understand the emplacement history of these mid-Proterozoic rapakivi granites. Aeromagnetic images reveal structures of ca. 5–10 km intrusions that build up the large rapakivi granite batholiths of Åland and Wiborg. Magnetic susceptibility data from the database of the Geological Survey of Finland, including more than 1700 samples from the Wiborg rapakivi batholith and almost 900 samples from the Åland rapakivi batholith, were compared with measurements from the present study. The mean susceptibility is ca. 1500 μSI for the Wiborg batholith and ca. 10,000 μSI for the Åland batholith. Samples taken for this study demonstrate that the mean value for the Ruotsinpyhtää intrusion is ca. 1200 μSI and for the Saltvik intrusions ca. 24,000 μSI. Thermomagnetic measurements reveal that the magnetic susceptibility is mainly derived either from paramagnetic minerals or from magnetite. The absence of solid-state deformation features such as breccia or contact deformation indicates a cauldron-type subsidence emplacement. The AMS measurements from Ruotsinpyhtää conﬁrm these proposals, with concentric gently dipping magnetic foliations that support a ring complex structure above a piston-type subsidence system. The Saltvik area consists of a number of smaller elliptical intrusions of different rapakivi granites forming a multiple intrusive complex. The magnetic fabric shows a general westward dipping of the pyterlite and eastward dipping of the contiguous even-grained rapakivi granite, which indicates a central inﬂow of magma batches towards the east and west resulting from a laccolitic emplacement of magma batches, while the main mechanism for space creation was derived from subsidence.},

This locality presents an artificially exhumed portion of an active fault plane, thus providing a unique opportunity to study kinematics and limestone scarp morphology (including its curvature and roughness). The survey of 2015 offered a high-density point cloud of the fault scarp with 6-mm working reso­ lution, creating a very close to real life representation 3D model. We found that scarp geometry is non-planar with increasing convexity up-dip and increasing northwesterly dip-directions from north towards south, along strike. Non-planarity is also recorded from the morphological data along strike with the appearance of several, slip-parallel troughs and ridges with a mean distance (half-wavelength) of 0.75 m. The fault-plane roughness (absolute values) is scale dependent. The roughness configuration attains a slip-parallel pattern for observation scales above 1-cm. At observations scales less than 1-cm a slip-normal pattern is weakly visible. The obtained TLS results agree with field data (manual compass measurements) and macroscopic observations. We infer an earthquake magnitude of 6.2 � 0.2 for the last event along the Pidima fault based on the measured thickness of the smooth stripe that was imaged by t-LiDAR along the non-exhumed surface of the scarp.},

We present fracture data is collected from four fold-thrust structures to determine how fracture connectivity, orientation, permeability anisotropy and ﬁll vary at different structural positions. We use a 3D model of the ﬁeld area, constructed using ﬁeld observations and bedding data, and geomechanically restored using Move software, to determine how factors such as fold curvature and strain inﬂuence fracture variation.},

While greatly contributing to our understanding of thrust systems, the usage of models can result in oversimpliﬁcation and false kinematic interpretations. This paper investigates how and if experts use structural models in the interpretation of a seismic image from a deepwater foldethrust belt. The results show that in the majority of cases experts produced interpretations that were compliant with key features in existing structural models. Those interpretations that were less compliant to existing models, better accounted for features present in natural and experimental analogues. This has implications for the general applicability of structural models in interpretation.},

	abstract = {Simulating ﬂow and transport in fractured porous media frequently involves solving numerical discretizations of partial differential equations with a large number of degrees of freedom using discrete fracture network (DFN) models. Uncertainty in the properties of the fracture network that controls ﬂow and transport requires a large number of DFN simulations to statistically describe quantities of interest. However, the computational cost of solving more than a few realizations of a large DFN can be intractable. As a means of circumventing this problem, we utilize both a high-ﬁdelity DFN model and a graph-based model of ﬂow and transport in combination with a multiﬁdelity Monte Carlo (MC) method to reduce the number of highﬁdelity simulations that are needed to obtain an accurate estimate of the quantity of interest. We demonstrate the approach by estimating quantiles of the breakthrough time for a conservative tracer in an ensemble of fractured porous media. Our results demonstrate that a multiﬁdelity MC estimate, whose computational cost is equal to the cost of 10 DFN simulations, can be as accurate as a standard MC estimate that utilizes 1,000 DFN simulations. Thus the combination of our graph-based model with multiﬁdelity MC estimates effectively reduces the computational cost of the problem by a factor of approximately 100.},

Available geological data are often remotely sensed (seismic data) or very limited in spatial extent (borehole data). Understanding how different datasets are interpreted and what makes an interpreter effective is critical if accurate geological models are to be created. A comparison of the interpretation outcome and techniques used by two cohorts interpreting different geological datasets of the same model, an inversion structure, was made. The ﬁrst cohort consists of interpreters of the synthetic seismic image data in Bond et al. (‘What do you think this is?: “Conceptual uncertainty” in geoscience interpretation’, GSA Today, 2007, 17, 4– 10, http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GSAT01711A.1); the second cohort is new and interpreted borehole data. The outcomes of the borehole interpretation dataset support earlier ﬁndings that technique use, speciﬁcally evidence of geological evolution thought processes, results in more effective interpretation. The results also show that the borehole interpreters were more effective at arriving at the correct interpretation. Analysis of their ﬁnal interpretations in the context of psychological and medical image analysis research suggests that the clarity of the original dataset, the amount of noise and white space may play a role in interpretation outcome, through enforced geological reasoning during data interpretation.},

We assess the visualization techniques by comparing landforms mapped from them against a detailed morphological map (derived from mapping of multi-azimuth relief-shaded DEMs cross-checked with stereo aerial photographs). Results show that no single visualization method provides complete and unbiased mapping. The relief-shaded visualizations are particularly prone to azimuth biasing, although they can highlight subtle landforms. We recommend curvature visualization for initial mapping as this provides a non-illuminated (and therefore unbiased) image. Initial mapping can then be supplemented with data from relief-shaded visualizations. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The unit, which is named the Petäjäskoski Formation (PFm) after the single location where the rocks are known to be exposed, is situated stratigraphically in the middle part of the Kivalo Group between the quartzites of the {\textgreater}2.22 Ga Palokivalo Formation and the mafic volcanic rocks of the {\textasciitilde}2.1 Ga Jouttiaapa Formation. The bulk of the PFm comprises phlogopitic-sericitic and albitic schists with abundant hematite as a diagnostic feature. Quartzite and dolomite interbeds are common. Based on drillcore and geophysical data, the succession is several hundreds of meters thick. The unit has prograde, chiefly lower greenschist facies mineral assemblages and, though being commonly intensely deformed, shows well-preserved sedimentary structures that imply deposition in shallow-water to subaerial environments. Based on the original lithological features, the Petäjäskoski Formation can be defined as a claystone-siltstone-sandstone-dolostone association. On the geochemical and stratigraphic basis, the albite schists likely represent albitized equivalents of the micaceous claystones and siltstones. They are intercalated with stratabound collapse breccias, up to tens of meters in thickness, with clasts composed mainly of bordering albite schist.},

In this study we analyze the impact of a speciﬁc kind of anisotropy, i.e. thin mechanical and frictional discontinuities, in affecting the development of reverse faults and of the associated folds using physical scaled models. We perform analog modeling introducing one or two initially horizontal, thin discontinuities above an initially blind fault dipping at 30 in one case, and 45 in another, and then compare the results with those obtained from a fully isotropic model. The experimental results show that the occurrence of thin discontinuities affects both the development and the propagation of new faults and the shape of the associated folds. New faults 1) accelerate or decelerate their propagation depending on the location of the tips with respect to the discontinuities, 2) cross the discontinuities at a characteristic angle ({\textasciitilde}90), and 3) produce folds with different shapes, resulting not only from the dip of the new faults but also from their non-linear propagation history. Our results may have direct impact on future kinematic models, especially those aimed to reconstruct the tectonic history of faults that developed in layered rocks or in regions affected by pre-existing faults.},

Fault-propagation fold hinges tighten and converge downward, forming a triangular zone of penetrative deformation focused on the tip of the propagating fault. The downward convergence of deformation in fault-propagation folds can be modeled as triangular shear zones. "Trishear," here defined as distributed, strain-compatible shear in a triangular (in profile) shear zone, provides an alternate kinematic model for fault-propagation folds. Trishear is analogous to simple shear in a tabular shear zone except that area balance in a triangular shear zone requires curved displacement oblique to the fault slip direction. Incremental computer models of trishear folding can replicate many geometric features of fault-propagation folds, including variably curved fold hinges, downward-tightening fold surfaces, heterogeneous strains, and multiple fault-propagation trajectories.},

	abstract = {Recent geological studies have provided new concepts concerning the timing of the final break-up of the Archaean craton. Age data on detrital zircons from sedimentary rocks in Sweden and Finland show marked similarities and indicate pervasive homogenization of accumulated material. Geochemical and isotopic studies in Sweden and Finland suggest the existence of two volcanic belts, separated by an area dominated by sedimentary rocks. However, the ages of metamorphism and plutonism differ; in particular, the late (post-l.85 Ga) granitoid rnagmatism was more voluminous in Sweden than in Finland. The Svecofennian crust in Finland is anomalously thick (up to 65 km) and is characterized by a high-velocity lower crust of variable thickness. The evolution of the Svecofennian Orogen is modelled by opening of the pre-Svecofennian ocean at 1.95 Ga and progressive accretion of two arc complexes to the Archaean craton between 1.91-1.87 Ga. Initial accretion at 1.91 Ga led to thrusting of the slices of an island arc complex and Proterozoic marine strata onto the thickening craton margin. Subduction reversal with simultaneous anti-clockwise rotation of the converging plate, or convergence of another plate, resulted in subduction below the newly accreted arc complex. The tectonic style at the craton margin changed from thrusting to lateral displacement in the east (in Finland). In the west (in Sweden), the subduction zone retreated along a transform fault. A large sedimentary basin closed in the east 1.89 Ga ago when another arc complex collided against the accreted one. Collision resulted in lithospheric thickening, subsequent delamination of the thickened lithosphere and compensation by a hot mantle underplate, and large-scale granitoid magmatism as a result of mixing between mantle magma and remelted arc complex material. The thick, dense layer that formed in the lower crust as the result of underplating kept the thickened crust in isostatic balance. Thus, the exhumation rate in this area was similar to the rate in areas of thinner crust. Subduction and sediment accumulation continued in the west until at least 1.87 Ga when large areas in the east were already stabilized. An intracratonic transpressional zone developed as the result of continued convergence. Subsequent extensional collapse along the transpressional zone caused melting of Svecofennian sedimentary rocks, migmatization and generation of the 1.84-1.82 Ga anatectic granites of southern Finland and central Sweden. The voluminous post-l.85 Ga granitoid magmatism in Sweden is tentatively associated with an east-west extension that is not related to the extensional collapse. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Fracture attribute scaling and connectivity datasets from analogue systems are widely used to inform sub-surface fractured reservoir models in a range of geological settings. However, signiﬁcant uncertainties are associated with the determination of reliable scaling parameters in surface outcrops. This has limited our ability to upscale key parameters that control ﬂuid ﬂow at reservoir to basin scales. In this study, we present nine 1D-transect (scanline) fault and fracture attribute datasets from Middle Devonian sandstones in Caithness (Scotland) that are used as an onshore analogue for nearby sub-surface reservoirs such as the Clair ﬁeld, west of Shetland. By taking account of truncation and censoring effects in individual datasets, our multiscale analysis shows a preference for power-law scaling of fracture length over 8 orders of magnitude (10−4 to 104 m) and kinematic aperture over 4 orders of magnitude (10−6 to 10−2 m). Our assessment of the spatial organization (clustering and topology) provides a new basis for up-scaling fracture attributes collected in outcrop- to regional-scale analogues. We show how these relationships may inform knowledge of geologically equivalent sub-surface fractured reservoirs.},

The associated hazards are typically defined by the orientation of structures and associated mechanisms of slope failure such as planar sliding, wedge sliding and toppling. A typical rock mass with multiple weak surfaces, or discontinuities, may form a consistent pattern over a range of spatial scale. The type of hazard resulting from the pattern of discontinuities will vary according to the angle and direction of the slope face. Assessing the risk of rock slope instability involves understanding of the complex three-dimensional structural features of the rock mass. Recent developments in stereographic methods show advantages are gained by representing wedges by linking great circles rather than showing the intersection line on the stereograph. We applied these methods to three rock slopes where active mass movement has occurred. The case studies include a large rock slide-debris avalanche in the Philippines, coastal cliffs in Australia and mining excavation slopes in Ghana, West Africa.},

The c. 60-m thick limestone is greenish gray in its lower and middle parts and it contains a fair abundance of acritarch species. The m ajority consist of Baltisphaeridium and Leiosphaera species belonging to subgroups of Acanthomorphitae and Sphaeromorphitae. In part, they are newly discovered species; in addition, there occurs a form designated as a new genus and given the name of the place where the discovery was made: Tranvikium polygonale. The lower part of the limestone bed in the Lumparn basin was probably deposited at the final stage of the Lower Ordovician, and the middle part during the Middle Ordovician.

	abstract = {Multiscale lineament and fracture extraction conducted within the Wiborg Rapakivi Batholith offers insights both into the brittle bedrock structures of the batholith and to the scale-dependence of lineament and fracture analysis results. Multiscale fracture studies from crystalline rocks are sparse even though brittle structures in the crystalline bedrock significantly affect the flow models of fluids, hydrothermal heat and hydrocarbons, and are the main factor controlling the permeability in crystalline rocks. The main goal of this study is to assess the scalability of lineament and fracture networks through statistic characterization of lineament and fracture datasets extracted from four scales of observation using geometric and topological parameters, and by studying the subsequent correlations between the dataset characterizations. The parameters are acquired from both the individual lineaments and fractures and from their respective networks. Brittle bedrock structures were extracted manually using two principle methods: lineament traces were digitized from Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models and fracture traces were digitized from drone-based orthophotography of bedrock outcrops. Both extractions result in two-dimensional datasets and, consequently, all characterizations of these datasets along with the scalability analysis results are limited to two dimensions. The crystalline Wiborg Rapakivi Batholith is structurally isotropic and lithologically sufficiently homogeneous so that the effect of both precursor fabrics and lithological variations can be ignored when considering the genesis and emplacement of brittle bedrock structures in the batholith. Scalability analyses conducted within this investigation revealed that the results of lineament and fracture network extractions are always dependent on the scale of observation. Even dimensionless parameters of networks, such as connectivity, were found to follow a scale-dependent trend: The apparent connectivity of a lineament or fracture network decreases as the scale of observation increases. The characterizations of the datasets were used for the interpretation of Wiborg Rapakivi Batholith fracture patterns and paleostresses, which could be compared to Olkiluoto site studies of paleostresses in southern Finland.},

during formation. These interactions mimic the natural processes of stress shadowing, termination of fractures on other fractures,
linking of fractures, and the varied growth on a single fracture due to contrasting rock properties. By simulating these interactions
and providing the user with fine control over them, the new fracture generation method can create simulated fracture networks that
match natural fracture networks more closely than other established methods. These behaviours are implemented mechanistically,
allowing fracture generation to be achieved without the significant additional computational cost required to explicitly model the
stresses in a fracturing rock volume. A suite of test cases is demonstrated, illustrating how different configurations of the fracture
model allow different connectivity characteristics to be modelled.},

	url = {https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2021112957679},
	abstract = {The main purpose of this MSc thesis is to study the 3D geometry of secondary microfractures
associated with faults by using grinding the tomography method. Information on the 3D
geometry of microfractures can be used, for example, for predicting the hydraulic conductivity
of rocks and for more accurate interpretation of generation mechanisms and kinematics of
faults. A 3D model of a microfracture network of one oriented rock sample was constructed
from data collected with grinding tomography methods. The interpretations made on the 3D
model were compared with the field measurements and GIS fracture trace interpretations based
on 2D orthophotography data collected with a drone and a digital SLR camera. The second
purpose of this thesis was to compare these two scales of 2D fracture trace datasets and find
out how the change of observation scale from meters to centimeters affects the 2D topology
and orientation distribution of the fracture networks. The study area is located on the Island of
Orrengrund, Loviisa, SW Finland. The fault studied in the thesis is a sinistral strike-slip fault
with a vertical dip, and a N-S trend.
In the grinding tomography method used in this thesis, a cylindrical 50*50*50 mm sample of
rock is glued on a glass plate and grinded in slices with a 3D-grinder, so that after each slice
the machine takes an image of the surface of the sample. When the images are combined by
knowing the vertical position of each image, interpretations can be made on the observed
fractures, and a 3D model can be constructed. In this thesis, a new GRN16 3D grinder of the
University of Turku geology section was used.
Grinding tomography images of the oriented rock sample were georeferenced on the
orthophotos with QGIS software, so that the orientation data obtained from the 3D model of
microfracture network was comparable with 2D fracture trace data and field measurements.
The results of the thesis showed that the 3D model of microfracture network constructed using
grinding tomography has almost perfect correlation with the orientation distribution and cross-
cut relationships of field measurements. The study also revealed that the new 3D grinder of
the University of Turku geology Section solves numerous problems regarding the use of the
grinding tomography method in geosciences. In addition, topological differences were
observed between the two different-scale 2D fracture trace datasets, reflecting that the
topological properties of the fault’s fracture systems could be scale-dependent.},

In particular, Mohr diagrams are used to show under what ﬂuid pressures and stresses different types and orientations of fractures are likely to be reactivated or generated. The approach enables the effects of parameters to be modelled individually, and for the types and orientations of fractures to be considered. This modelling is useful for helping geoscientists consider, model, and predict the ranges of mechanical properties of rock, stresses, ﬂuid pressures, and the resultant fractures that are likely to occur in the sub-surface.

However, the development of best practices for high quality of UAV mapping are often overlooked representing a drawback for their wider adoption. UAV solutions then require an inter-disciplinary research, integrating different expertise and combining several hardware and software com­ ponents on the same platform. Despite the high number of peer-reviewed papers on UAVs, little attention has been given to the interaction between research topics from different domains (such as robotics and computer vision) that impact the use of UAV in remote sensing. The aim of this paper is to (i) review best practices for the use of UAVs for remote sensing and mapping applications and (ii) report on current trends - including adjacent domains - for UAV use and discuss their future impact in photogrammetry and remote sensing. Hardware de­ velopments, navigation and acquisition strategies, and emerging solutions for data processing in innovative applications are considered in this analysis.

wide range of different geophysical survey methods using various geometries and scales of
investigation. The measurements have been done from the air, ground surface, shallow and deep
drillholes and the ONKALO underground facility. As a part of the complementary site
investigations, two low-altitude geophysical airborne survey campaigns were done around and at
Olkiluoto in 2008 and 2009. The survey in 2008 was focused in the Eurajoensalmi area N or NE
of Olkiluoto Island. The survey in 2009 covered most of the Olkiluoto Island, the neighbouring
sea area and the archipelago W, SW and S of Olkiluoto as well as some of the mainland area SE
of Olkiluoto.
This report presents a new lineament interpretation based on these new geophysical airborne
surveys. For the interpretation work, the data were extensively further processed into different
gradients and filtered data sets and maps. Furthermore, the potential of automatic curvature
analyses was examined. Also, quantitative profile interpretation was done from a number of
profiles to find out the dips and exact locations of the contacts of some features.
The qualitative interpretation of the lineaments was carried out by visually inspecting the different
versions of the geophysical maps and by digitizing the geometry of each interpreted lineament.
The lineaments are collated into two ArcGIS themes (one for magnetic and one for EM
lineaments), accompanied by an attribute table that includes a number of attributes for each
interpreted feature: lineament identifier, reference to the data used in interpretation, uncertainty,
length, average orientation and probable geological character.
The total number of new interpreted features is 125 magnetic and 33 electromagnetic lineaments.
The main trend of the interpreted features varies between WNW-ESE and NNW-SSE.
Furthermore, trends in directions almost N-S and E-W are also dominating. The EM lineaments
are mainly related to electrically conductive narrow sea areas between the islands. Accordingly,
they may be indirect indications of deformation zones.
In addition to the sole geophysical interpretation, the result is also merged with the revision of the
most recent previous lineament interpretation, based on several data sources, such as geophysics,
topography and bathymetry. The compiled interpretation, resulting in altogether 200 lineaments,
serves as one starting point when constructing the geological model of the Olkiluoto site.},

Here, we estimate the amount of groundwater present in the upper 10 km of the Earth's continental crust by examining the distribution of sedimentary and crystalline rocks with depth and applying porosity-depth relationships. We demonstrate that groundwater in the 2–10 km zone (what we call “deep groundwater”) has a volume comparable to that of groundwater in the upper 2 km of the Earth's crust. These new estimates make groundwater the largest continental reservoir of water, ahead of ice sheets, provide a basis to quantify geochemical cycles, and constrain the potential for large-scale isolation of waste fluids.},

Shallower circulation occurs in sedimentary and shield-type environments with subdued topography. The amount of topographic relief available to drive regional groundwater flow and flush saline fluids is an important control on the extent of meteoric water circulation, in addition to permeability.

This paper introduces a coupled method for computing length exponent (E) and spatial density (Dc), the two most essential parameters for modelling fracture networks. To calculate the length exponent, data sets of at least two independent imaging processes are needed. Utilizing different sensitivity thresholds of the two methods and the well-known analytical form of a fracture length distribution function, its parameters can be calculated. To estimate the spatial density of fracture centres in 3D, the series of intersections should be analysed as a fractional Brownian motion and then calibrated with virtual wells simulated with optional modelling software. The method makes fracture intensity logging possible along scanlines. Based on these approaches, there is no need to import fracture parameters from the outcrop survey or from other parts of the reservoir, because all geometric information of the fracture system refers to the rock body under examination. Using sitespeciﬁc parameters makes fracture network modelling more reliable.},

              Length frequency distributions of fractures are shown to have a power-law trend across many orders of magnitude. This allows an estimate to be made of the full number of fractures and faults existing in a reservoir over that which can be measured from core and seismic data. This relationship has been applied to reservoir studies involving the continuity of juxtaposed sands, permeability impairment, and estimating the number of fractures that a horizontal well may intersect.
              Many more fractures and faults exist in reservoirs than those that can he observed from seismic and core data, which have significant implications for reservoir characterisation, geomechanical properties and waterflood behaviour.
              
                Introduction
                There is a tendency for natural fractures in reservoirs to gain the attention of development teams only when the fractures provide permeability significantly greater than that of the matrix: usually in reservoirs which would not be commercially productive without the presence of those fractures. These reservoirs are deemed as 'naturally fractured' and are, of course, an important resource in the hydrocarbon industry. However, the somewhat loose application of this term tends to lead to the neglect of natural fractures as a component in the description of a much larger set of reservoirs.
                By the term 'fractures' we encompass both joints (extension fractures) and faults (all fractures whose walls have undergone shear displacements). The wider importance of natural fractures includes the following:Juxtaposition of different lithologies across faults can cause either an interruption in reservoir continuity, or enhancement due to the juxtaposition (across non-sealing faults) of depositionally isolated units.Fractures provide surfaces with an intrinsic conductivity that is almost certainly different from that of the surrounding matrix, occurring either through genesis (e.g. the cataclastic grain comminution in a granulation seam), diagenesis (i.e. mineralisation) or aperture governed by present-day effective stress. These altered surfaces can form a first-order perturbation to the permeability variations arising from depositional processes. In addition, the intrinsic conductivity of a fracture can change as stresses change in the reservoir rock during the development life of a field. There is growing evidence of the dominant influence of fractures in the lateral anisotropy of waterfloods, a process in which the reduction in stresses due to injection probably plays a significant role. The geomechanical behaviour of natural fractures during depletion may manifest itself as an influence upon compaction drive, subsidence and even casing failures.
                The presence of natural fractures carries particular implications when development of a reservoir with horizontal or high-angle wells is considered. The most obvious change is that high-angle wells have a greater probability than conventional wells of intersecting sub-vertical or vertical fractures. This fact has led to spectacular successes in the exploitation of reservoirs containing conductive natural fractures, for example in the Austin chalk of Texas.
                Additionally, the influence of natural fractures on the viability of horizontal or high-angle wells may be effective in at least two other ways:The productivity benefit of a high-angle well is very dependent upon the effective ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability. Fractures can increase or decrease this ratio.Conductive natural fractures and faults may provide pathways forextraneous water production from an underlying aquifer or gas production from a gas cap.
                In all these applications a knowledge of the true frequency distribution of fractures is a necessary component in a complete synthesis of the process. However, direct measurement of the distribution is hindered because reservoir fractures are observable only in the relatively limited ranges in scale of seismic and core data.
                We examine in this paper the concept that scaling relationships in fracture distributions enable the quantitative interpolation between the ranges of observable fracture sizes. We are concerned here primarily with spatial frequency distributions of fractures. A knowledge of the true form of these is a first step towards being able to predict the effect of fractures on fluid flow, but the subsequent steps of connectivity and conductivity are beyond the scope of this paper.
              
              
                REVIEW OF FRACTURE DISTRIBUTIONS
                The literature dealing with fractures in rock covers many disciplines and industries. Many assessments of frequency distributions of fracture lengths and spacings have been reported. The distributions have usually been given as one of log normal, negative exponential, gamma, Weibull, or occasionally power law or Pareto.

Despite the absence of any characteristic length scale of the power-law model, the flow structure appears to contain three length scales at the very maximum: the connecting scale, the channelling scale, and the homogenization scale, above which the equivalent permeability tends to a constant value.

	abstract = {This report describes the methods, analyses, and conclusions of the modeling team in the production of the
2010 revision to the geological discrete fracture network (DFN) model for the Olkiluoto Site in Finland. The
geological DFN is a statistical model for stochastically simulating rock fractures and minor faults at a scale
ranging from approximately 0.05 m to approximately 565m; deformation zones are expressly excluded from
the DFN model. The DFN model is presented as a series of tables summarizing probability distributions for
several parameters necessary for fracture modeling: fracture orientation, fracture size, fracture intensity, and
associated spatial constraints.
The geological DFN is built from data collected during site characterization (SC) activities at Olkiluoto,
which is selected to function as a final deep geological repository for spent fuel and nuclear waste from the
Finnish nuclear power program. Data used in the DFN analyses include fracture maps from surface outcrops
and trenches, geological and structural data from cored drillholes, and fracture information collected during
the construction of the main tunnels and shafts at the ONKALO laboratory.
Unlike the initial geological DFN, which was focused on the vicinity of the ONKALO tunnel, the 2010
revisions present a model parameterization for the entire island. Fracture domains are based on the tectonic
subdivisions at the site (northern, central, and southern tectonic units) presented in the Geological Site
Model (GSM), and are further subdivided along the intersection of major brittle-ductile zones. The rock
volume at Olkiluoto is dominated by three distinct fracture sets: subhorizontally-dipping fractures striking
north-northeast and dipping to the east that is subparallel to the mean bedrock foliation direction, a
subvertically-dipping fracture set striking roughly north-south, and a subvertically-dipping fracture set
striking approximately east-west. The subhorizontally-dipping fractures account for most (65 \% - 75 \%,
depending on fracture domain) of the total observed fracture intensity at Olkiluoto.
Inside a given fracture domain, fracture intensity is adequately represented as a Gamma distribution at the 10
m scale and larger, though near-surface depth-dependence is noted in the foliation-subparallel set in a few
fracture domains. There is little difference between open and sealed fractures, though flowing fracture
intensity decreases rapidly below approximately -200 masl. Fracture locations are modeled assuming a 3D
Poisson point process. Two alternative size models are assessed; the models differ in terms of whether the
power-law scaling exponent is derived solely from surface outcrop data (OSM) or from a combination of
outcrop-scale, tunnel-scale, and deformation-zone scale data (TCM). The consequences of the uncertainty in
the model parameterization is identified and quantified, with the largest effects (on the order of five to seven
times) due to uncertainty in the size model.},

	abstract = {Integrated structural/geochronological studies help unraveling complex brittle deformation histories. We have analysed the structural geological database of brittle faults from the ONKALO™ underground facility for spent nuclear fuel in Olkiluoto in southwestern Finland. Based on the structural geological data from eleven repre­ sentative fault zones, we classify the Olkiluoto brittle structural features into four fault systems, referred to as Fault system I to IV. The classification is based on their structural properties and tectonic history, crosscutting relationships, fault rock mineralogical characterization and 3D modelling. Some constraints on the timing of faulting are provided by K-Ar dates on synkinematic illite from fault gouge samples. Our results show that the bedrock in southwestern Finland experienced numerous brittle deformation phases between ca. 1.75 and 0.9 Ga. N-S strike-slip faults (Fault systems I and II) formed at mid-crustal levels ca. 1.79–1.75 Ga ago in response to NWSE/NNW-SSE compression soon after the Svecofennian orogeny. Later E-W striking oblique dextral/normal faults (Fault system III) are tentatively associated with the Gothian orogeny 1.6 Ga ago. These three fault systems were reactivated during NE-SW compression ca. 1.3–1.2 Ga ago, coeval with intrusion of a regional swarm of olivine diabase sills. E-W compression at the onset of the Sveconorwegian orogeny ca. 1.1–1.0 Ga ago resulted in the formation of SE dipping low-angle thrust faults (Fault system IV) and the selective reactivation of fault system II and III. Overall E-W extension during the collapse of the Sveconorwegian orogen ca. 0.97–0.87 Ga ago caused the localised reactivation of fault systems III and IV. Our research approach, which is integral to the siting process of repositories for spent nuclear fuel, demonstrates that the basement in southwestern Finland experienced repeated reactivation since the Mesoproterozoic, suggesting that future deformation localization is likely to be also accommodated by reactivation of existing brittle structures rather than formation of new faults.},

Direct acquisition of data on reservoirs is labor-intensive and generally produces sparse information. Thus, the study of analogue outcrops with similar characteristics is often carried out by using unmanned aerial vehicle image acquisition and digital photogrammetry. However, the accurate automatic recognition of the fractures network over the outcrop images remains a challenge. Image segmentation methods based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) were successfully applied in medicine, biology, and other areas, however, not yet in geological fracture detection. This work proposes the validation of two popular CNNs - Segnet and Unet - for pixel-topixel segmentation targeting fracture detection.

Here, structural analyses of Virtual Outcrop Models (VOM) integrated with Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modelling are used to constrain the relationship between meso-scale fracture patterns and the bulk permeability of a regional-scale fault zone. The Goddo Fault Zone (GFZ, Bømlo – Norway) is a longlived extensional fault zone cutting across a granodioritic body developed during the long-lasting rifting of the North Sea. Fracture geometrical characteristics and the spatial variation of fracture intensity derived from VOM structural analysis were adopted as input for stochastic DFN models representing selected portions of the GFZ to constrain the variability of the structural permeability tensor K related to the mesoscopic fracture pattern. The intensity of fault-related fracture set(s), and the associated structural permeability computed with DFN models, likely exhibits a decreasing power-law trend within the damage zone with increasing distance from the fault cores. The orientation of the maximum K tensor component is controlled by the intersection direction of the dominant fracture sets. These results highlight the fundamental role of mesoscopic fracture patterns in con­ trolling the bulk petrophysical properties of large fault zones.},

	abstract = {The fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum are widely used to characterize the complexity of natural fractures. However, systematic investigations, considering impacts of different fracture geometrical properties (fracture lengths, orientations, center positions) and system sizes, on the fractal and multifractal characterization of complex fracture networks are insufficient. Here, we utilize an in-house developed DFN modeling software, HATCHFRAC, to construct stochastic fracture networks with prescribed distributions and systematically study the impact of three geometrical properties of fractures and system sizes on the fractal and multifractal character­ ization. We calculate the single fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum with the box-counting method. The single fractal dimension, D, and the difference of singularity exponent, Δα, are used to represent the fractal and multifractal patterns, respectively. We find that fracture lengths, orientations and system sizes positively correlate with D and Δα, while the system size has the most significant impact among the four parameters. D is uncorrelated with fracture positions (FD), which means that a single fractal dimension cannot capture the complexity caused by clustering effects. However, Δα has a strong negative correlation with FD, implying that clustering effects make fracture networks more complex, and Δα can capture the difference. We also digitize 80 outcrop maps with a novel fracture detection algorithm and calculate their fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum. We find wide variations of D and Δα on those outcrop maps, even for outcrops at similar scales, indicating that a universal indicator for characterizing fracture networks at different scales or the same scale is almost impossible. D and Δα have negligible correlations with scales, supporting the self-similarity patterns of natural fracture networks.},

	abstract = {Quantitative characterization of discontinuities is fundamental to deﬁne the mechanical behavior of discontinuous rock masses. Several techniques for the semi-automatic and automatic extraction of discontinuities and their properties from raw or processed point clouds have been introduced in the literature to overcome the limits of conventional ﬁeld surveys and improve data accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not allow characterizing ﬂat or subvertical outcrops because planar surfaces are difﬁcult to detect within point clouds in these circumstances, with the drawback of undersampling the data and providing inappropriate results. In this case, 2D analysis on the fracture traces are more appropriate. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, few methods to perform quantitative analyses on discontinuities from orthorectiﬁed photos are publicly available and do not provide a complete characterization. We implemented scanline and window sampling methods in a digital environment to characterize rock masses affected by discontinuities perpendicular to the bedding from trace maps, thus exploiting the potentiality of remote sensing techniques for subvertical and low-relief outcrops. The routine, named QDC-2D (Quantitative Discontinuity Characterization, 2D) was compiled in MATLAB by testing a synthetic dataset and a real case study, from which a high-resolution orthophoto was obtained by means of Structure from Motion technique. Starting from a trace map, the routine semi-automatically classiﬁes the discontinuity sets and calculates their mean spacing, frequency, trace length, and persistence. The fracture network is characterized by means of trace length, intensity, and density estimators. The block volume and shape are also estimated by adding information on the third dimension. The results of the 2D analysis agree with the input used to produce the synthetic dataset and with the data collected in the ﬁeld by means of conventional geostructural and geomechanical techniques, ensuring the procedure’s reliability. The outcomes of the analysis were implemented in a Discrete Fracture Network model to evaluate their applicability for geomechanical modeling.},

	abstract = {The present study used a multitool approach to characterize fractures of several orders of magnitude in large fracture corridors, caves, and canyons to investigate their impact on fluid flow in carbonate units. The study area is the Brejo˜es carbonate karst system that is located in the Neoproterozoic Salitre Formation in the Irecˆe Basin, Sa˜o Francisco Craton, Brazil. The approach included satellite imagery, used for interpreting the regional struc­ tural context, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and ground-based Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) imagery, used for detailed structural interpretation. Regional interpretation revealed that fracture corridors, caves and canyons occur along a N–S-oriented anticline hinge. An advanced stage of karstification caused fracture enlargement and intrabed dissolution, and the formation of caves and canyons. A river captured by the highly fractured zone along the anticline hinge played an important role as an erosive agent. Detailed characterization of fracture corridors comprised structural analysis, topological studies, persistence estimations, power-law fitting of fracture trace length distributions, and identification of network backbones. Our results indicate that fracture corridors comprise four subvertical fracture sets: N–S and E-W and a conjugate pair, NNE-SSW and NW-SE. Fractures observed in the caves show the same dominant directions. Fracture directions are consistent with a common origin associated with the anticline folding. Fracture traces range from 1.0 m to 300 m, comprising both subseismic ({\textless}50 m) and seismic scale fractures ({\textgreater}50 m). Networks have dominance of node terminations Y and X (notably Y), CB values higher than 1.8, high P20 and P21 persistence values, and highly interconnected backbones. Fracture network connectivity is associated with power-law exponents greater than 2.5 for the fracture trace distributions, indicating large influence of subseismic-scale fractures on fluid flow. As the final result of folding and karstification, large volumes of secondary macroporosity were created, particularly in the zone of maximum fracture intensity around the hinge zone of the anticline. This scenario can be used to understand better oil reservoirs formed in similar structural controls in near-surface conditions.},

In recent years, we have seen an increase in the availability of geological modeling methods. However, many of these methods are difficult to use due to preliminary data processing steps, which can be specifically difficult for geoscientific data in geographic coordinate systems.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;We attempt to simplify the access to open-source spatial data processing for geological modeling with the development of GemGIS, a Python-based open-source library. GemGIS wraps and extends the functionality of packages known to the geo-community such as GeoPandas, Rasterio, OWSLib, Shapely, PyVista, Pandas, NumPy and the geomodelling package GemPy. The aim of GemGIS, as indicated by the name, is to become a bridge between conventional geoinformation systems (GIS) such as ArcGIS and QGIS, and geomodelling tools such as GemPy, allowing simpler and more automated workflows from one environment to the other.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Data within the different disciplines of geosciences are often available in a variety of data formats that need to be converted or transformed for visualization in 2D and 3D and subsequent geomodelling methods. This is where GemGIS comes into play. GemGIS is capable of working with vector data created in GIS systems through GeoPandas, Pandas and Shapely, with raster data through rasterio and NumPy, with data obtained from web services such as maps or digital elevation models through OWSLib and with meshes through PyVista. Support for geophysical data and additional geo-formats are constantly added.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The GemGIS package already contains several tutorials explaining how the different modules can be used to process spatial data. It was decided against creating new data classes in case users are already familiar with concepts such as (Geo-)DataFrames in (Geo-)Pandas or PolyData/Grids in PyVista.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The GemGIS package is hosted at https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis, the documentation is available at https://gemgis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html. GemGIS is also available on PyPi. You can install GemGIS in your Python environment using \&amp;\#8216;pip install gemgis\&amp;\#8217;.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;We welcome contributions to the project through pull requests and are open to suggestions and comments, also over Github issues, especially about possible links to other existing software developments and approaches to integrate geoscientific data processing and geomodelling.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

However, few open-source packages are capable of handling large, spatiallyreferenced datasets and some are powerful yet have inherently complex application programming interfaces (APIs), which might create a barrier to entry for new users. Notably, VTK is a powerful scientific visualization software library, and with Python bindings, it combines the speed of C++ with the rapid prototyping of Python. Despite this, VTK code programmed in Python using the base VTK Python package is unnecessarily complicated as its API binds existing C++ calls. The PyVista Python package provides a concise, well-documented interface exposing VTK’s powerful visualization backend; enabling researchers to rapidly explore large datasets, communicate their spatial findings, and facilitate reproducibility. PyVista further seeks to simplify standard mesh creation and plotting routines without compromising on the speed of the C++ VTK backend.},

	abstract = {This work presents a framework to analyze geometrical, topological and hydraulic properties of 3D Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) and to estimate its properties near percolation threshold. A set of efficient algorithms has been developed to perform geometrical and topological analyses upon 3D networks of planar fractures with various shapes (mainly circular and elliptical fractures). This toolbox is capable of (i) calculating all possible intersections in the 3D network, and calculating also the resulting trace lengths, and other geometrical attributes of the DFN; (ii) extracting the percolating clusters and eliminating dead end clusters; (iii) constructing the corresponding graph of the 3D network of planar fractures. All the calculations implemented with these algo­ rithms have been strictly validated by direct numerical simulations. The graph representation of the DFN enables the application of broad-purpose algorithms inspired by graph theory and percolation theory (among other applications). It is demonstrated that the use of our toolbox as a pre-treatment (extracting the percolation network, eliminating all dead-end fractures and clusters, and searching for shortest paths), considerably reduces the CPU time of flow/transport simulations. The gain on CPU time was of several orders of magnitude for networks containing thousands of fractures. The computational efficiency of the tools permits a broad study on the percolation in 3D fracture networks. The two main results presented in this paper concern two important issues: (i) a new procedure is developed for the numerical determination of the critical percolation density based on the marginal percolation concept; and (ii) an enhanced formula with low sensitivity to fracture shape, orientation, and size distribution, is proposed for estimating the critical percolation density.},

	abstract = {Representing fractures explicitly using a discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is often necessary to model the complex physics that govern thermo-hydro-mechanical–chemical processes (THMC) in porous media. DFNs ﬁnd applications in modelling geothermal heat recovery, hydrocarbon exploitation, and groundwater ﬂow. It is advantageous to construct DFNs from the photogrammetry of fractured outcrop analogues as the DFNs would capture realistic, fracture network properties. Recent advances in drone photogrammetry have greatly simpliﬁed the process of acquiring outcrop images, and there is a remarkable increase in the volume of image data that can be routinely generated. However, manually digitizing fracture traces is time-consuming and inevitably subject to interpreter bias. Additionally, variations in interpretation style can result in different fracture network geometries, which, may then inﬂuence modelling results depending on the use case of the fracture study. In this paper, an automated fracture trace detection technique is introduced. The method consists of ridge detection using the complex shearlet transform coupled with post-processing algorithms that threshold, skeletonize, and vectorize fracture traces. The technique is applied to the task of automatic trace extraction at varying scales of rock discontinuities, ranging from 100 to 102 m. We present automatic trace extraction results from three different fractured outcrop settings. The results indicate that the automated approach enables the extraction of fracture patterns at a volume beyond what is manually feasible. Comparative analysis of automatically extracted results with manual interpretations demonstrates that the method can eliminate the subjectivity that is typically associated with manual interpretation. The proposed method augments the process of characterizing rock fractures from outcrops.},

	abstract = {Bedrock of Finland 1:200 000 is a unified bedrock map dataset covering the whole Finland. It has been compiled by generalising the scale-free bedrock map feature dataset. The dataset consists of a lithological/stratigraphic geological unit polygon layer and linear layers, in which faults, diverse overprinting lines and dykes are represented. The dataset also includes an origin of the data and a quality estimation of the data polygon layers. The stratigraphic geological unit polygon layer includes lithological coding, geological time period and hierarchical lithostratigraphical or lithodemic classification as attributes in accordance with the Finnish database for stratigrafic geological units (Finstrati). The line layers have their own hierarchical classification. The data are at 1:200 000 scale, which indicates that the main part of the scale-free data have been generalised to correspond to a product at a scale of 1:200 000. Those areas where the source data is coarser than 1:200 000 have not been generalised. Coordinate reference system of the dataset was transformed in March 2013. The transformation from Finnish National Grid Coordinate System (Kartastokoordinaattijärjestelmä, KKJ) Uniform Coordinate Frame to ETRS-TM35FIN projection was done by using the three-dimensional transformation in accordance with the recommendations for the public administration JHS154.},

We use concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be in glacial polish and measurements of bedrock fracture spacing to explore the relationship between erosion rates and rock fracturing at 23 sites along Tuolumne River valley and ﬁve sites in Tenaya Canyon in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. Most sites yield 10Be concentrations that can be best explained as reﬂecting solely postglacial nuclide accumulation. Six sites, however, display anomalously high concentrations, implying incomplete removal of the pre-glacial nuclide inventory during the last glaciation; these require that erosion in the last glacial cycle was {\textless}2–3 m. These low-erosion sites occur preferentially in massive units of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite and the El Capitan Granite. Fractures in high-erosion sites are more closely spaced than in low-erosion sites, with spacings that average 1.1 ± 0.03 m and 3.3 ± 0.1 m, respectively. Our data suggest that the distance between fractures in the rock, dictated in part by the original spacing in a particular pluton, and in part by the speciﬁc tectonic history of the Sierra Nevada, governs the pace of glacial erosion in Yosemite.},

Therefore, developing suitable methodologies for acquiring structural data and simulating flow through fractured media is vital to improve efficiency and reduce uncertainties in modelling the subsurface. Outcrop analogues provide excellent areas for the analysis and characterization of fractures within the reservoir rocks where subsurface data are limited. Variation in fracture arrangement, distribution and connectivity can be obtained from 2D fractured cliff sections and pavements. These sections can then be used for efficient discretization and homogenization techniques to obtain reliable predictions on permeability distributions in the geothermal reservoirs. Fracture network anisotropy in the Malm reservoir unit is assessed using detailed structural analysis and numerical homogenization of outcrop analogues from an open pit quarry within the Franconian Basin, Germany. Several events are recorded in the fracture networks from the Late Jurassic the Alpine Orogeny and are observed to be influenced by the Kulmbach Fault nearby with a reverse throw of 800 m. The fractured outcrops are digitized for fluid flow simulations and homogenization to determine the permeability tensors of the networks. The tensors show differences in fluid transport direction where fracture permeability is controlled by orientation compared to a constant value. As a result, it is observed that the orientation of the tensor is influenced by the Kulmbach Fault, and therefore faults within the reservoirs at depth should be considered as important controls on the fracture flow of the geothermal system.},

	title = {Alternative {Conceptual} {Models} for {Flow} and {Transport} in {Olkiluoto} {Fracture} {Systems}},
	url = {https://www.posiva.fi/en/index/media/reports.html},
	abstract = {The third generation of discrete fracture network model (ODFN3) developed as part of
the Olkiluoto site description (OSD) 2018 represents a culmination of the latest integrated
geological, hydrogeological, rock mechanical and hydrogeochemical interpretation of
bedrock fracturing at Olkiluoto on a site scale, which has been used extensively in support
of assessments of groundwater flows, groundwater pathways, radionuclide migration and
hydrogeochemical evolution, past and future. The model applied a well-defined and
comprehensive methodology to make intepretations, select conceptual models, perform
sensitivity analyses, calibrate parameters and test predictions against observed outcomes.
A series of prediction-outcome exercises have been initiated alongside ODFN3 to test
and demonstrate reliability of the model using new data acquired during construction of
the technical facilities, accesses tunnels and deposition areas. This is the basis for Posiva’s
response to Requirement 6A on verifying the reliability of the DFN model. The model
has proven reliable against basic geometrical properties and flow statistics.
Requirement 6C is aimed at further justification of the selection of DFN modelling to
underpin assessments of safety critical parameters such as flow-related transport
resistance and the distribution of flow on the surface of the deposition holes/buffer that
could affect mechanical erosion, and further assessments of the reliability of the model.
The current report is aimed at closing that part of the requirement through:
• Summarising evidence of dimensionality of flow from past interpretations of
transient hydraulic tests in surface drilled holes, recent evaluations of the
continuity of flow and flow dimension from pre-grouting operations in the
four shafts, and interpretation of recent transient tests in the pilot holes for the
deposition tunnels;
• Exploring alternative conceptual models (ACMs) for how flow might be
distributed within fractures, considering aspects of hard channelling by
constrictions or soft channelling by heterogeneity in the plane or long linear
flow channels, to illustrate how such models can be made to reflect measured
flow conditions at Olkiluoto; and
• Quantifying the consequences of these different ACMs for safety critical
parameters, and examining whether these models produce any measurable
flow characteristics that might differentiate them.
Interpretations of the latest transient hydraulic tests from the pilot holes for deposition
tunnels have once again confirmed flow dimensions of two or above. This is consistent
with an interpretation of divergent (2D) flow, of grout injections into fractures
intersecting probe holes ahead of the construction of four shafts, with fractions of 30-
100\% conductive fracture area seen in PFL testing in the dense arrays of probe holes
drilled ahead of each shaft, and earlier flow dimension analysis in surface drilled holes
that found dimensions above 1.5 in 75\% of tests. Together, these different suites of data
all confirm a picture that where flow occurs it widely connects to form an essentially 2D
distribution of flow divergent or convergent on a pumped drillhole, but this flow can be
significantly heterogeneous within the fracture plane.
Insights on the spatial distribution of flow within fractures has been obtained by analysing
the variability in transmissivity in the same interpreted structures and obtained from PFL
logging in dense arrays of probe holes at depth within the circumference of each shaft.
This provides a basis for both an estimate of a typical length scale for variability and a
geostatistical model of variability. Significantly, this length scale is less than the spacing
of connected fractures at depth, which means that for flow to take place on a fracture, the
amount of open apertures within a fracture must generally be above the percolation
threshold, 50\% for flow in 2D. This length scale is smaller than used in the ODFN3, and
in order to still match the measured flow distribution, the amount of open fracture area
must be increased to compensate for the potential reduction in percolation within a plane.
The result is that more deposition holes become connected and experience small flow,
but flow related transport resistance is unchanged. Applying a concept where flow can
take place over each fracture plane but with a structured and high variability also implies
that more deposition holes experience some flow and transport resistance is slightly
reduced. A pipe network also leads to an increase in the number of deposition holes
because more open area (a pipe must still have a concept of flow width if it is to be
intersected by drillholes) is needed to compensate for the reduced transverse connectivity,
but again has very similar transport resistance to ODFN3. Hence, in conclusion, transport
resistance appears to be insensitive to the choice of conceptual model provided that the
models are calibrated to match the observed intensity and distribution of flows as
measured by PFL, but the amount of deposition holes that experience some flow can
increase. This may have subtle implications for safety with more deposition holes
receiving small water flows helping resaturate the buffer and also more open fracture
surface area over which sorption and rock matrix diffusion can take place.
Given the need to have a structural framework for flow for any of the ACMs, the extra
assumptions required to ensure a channel network connects to drillholes in a way that
reflects data and is useful in predicting flows around deposition holes, and the field
evidence for essentially 2D flow, it is clear that channel networks offer little more than a
potentially more numerically efficient representation of flow and transport for some niche
applications.
The ACMs have demonstrated that the most apparent measurable difference between
different concepts for how flow is spatially distributed can be seen when comparing
specific capacity as measured under steady-state conditions, e.g. under PFL conditions,
and transmissivity interpreted from transient flow tests. The difference is greatest for a
model with hard channelling, e.g. a patchwork of open and closed areas and when the
scale of the variability is as large as the spacing of open connected fractures, and least for
soft channelling where the transmissivity field is continuously varying. The data lies
between these two extremes, suggesting scales of variability of no more than several
metres and some structured continuity to the transmissivity variability.},

	abstract = {Olkiluoto Island, which is located in SW Finland, has been selected as the site for a deep
geological repository for the high-level spent nuclear fuel generated by the nuclear power
plants operated by the Finnish power companies TVO and Fortum.
On behalf TVO and Fortum, Posiva has continued updating the multidisciplinary site
description, toward the last licencing stage of the repository – the application of the
operating licence. Characterisation data comes from 58 deep cored drillholes, a wide
variety of geophysical investigations, many outcrops, kilometres of underground
mapping and testing in the ONKALO research facility, and groundwater pressure
monitoring and sampling in both deep and shallow holes. A third generation of Olkiluoto
discrete fracture network, ODFN3, model has been developed to provide an integrated
description of geological, hydrogeological, geomechanical and transport properties of
natural fractures and brittle fault zones at the site.
The purposes of the DFN include: providing a basis for flow and transport calculations
from deposition holes to the far-field; simulations of how hydrogeological and
hydrogeochemical conditions around the repository evolve over time; and as a decision
support tool in the development of operational acceptance criteria for disposal at a specific
location given local investigation data. Hence, the ODFN3 model provides both statistical
distributions of properties over the whole repository area and predictions specific to local
geological conditions. With these needs in mind, fracturing related to faults is represented
as swarms of fractures within their damage zones, while background fracture patterns are
correlated to tectonic unit, lithology and depth. Hydraulic properties of fractures are
described along hydromechanical principles according to size, morphology/mineralogy
characteristics and stress field.
This report provides a detailed traceable record of how each facet of the ODFN3 model
has been conceptualised, represented in numerical DFN models and calibrated against
site data. It presents numerical sensitivity tests to quantify the consequences of conceptual
and parameter uncertainties. Confirmation of the suitability of the model is provided
through simulation of hydraulic interference tests on two scales and
palaeohydrogeological evolution of groundwater composition. Finally, a plan for
validating that the model is fit for purpose is formulated as a series of prediction-outcome
exercises using mapping and hydraulic testing data from new construction areas, with a
first exercise to test and inform the forward plan documented here.},

	abstract = {As part of the Posiva's safety case for the operational licence application of the spent
nuclear fuel repository at Olkiluoto it needs to identify and assess scenarios for the far
future evolution of the Olkiluoto disposal site. The methodology for scenario formulation
identifies the most important factors of uncertainty in the knowledge of the evolution of
the disposal system. These factors are termed as "key factors" (KFs). One of the KFs is
defined to capture the uncertainty in the knowledge of future earthquakes associated with
glacial loading and unloading of the crust and their consequences for the performance of
the disposal system. Such a far into the future earthquake may lead to or contribute to an
evolutionary path that leads to a loss of canister's integrity. The radiological consequences
of such incidents are analysed in the TURVA-2020 Analysis of Releases (AOR) report.
The long-term seismic hazard potentially affecting the repository can be reduced to the
following cases related to displacement induced by the seismic event:


The deposited canister is intersected by a fault on which an earthquake and the
related primary displacement can occur, or
The deposited canister is intersected by a large enough fracture to host damaging
secondary displacements induced by the quasi-static and dynamic effects of an
earthquake occurring at a distance from the fracture.
The hazard imposed by the primary displacement can be mitigated straightforwardly by
avoiding canister emplacement within fault cores and their associated damage zones,
where most of the slip takes place during an earthquake. Consequently, the seismic hazard
is reduced to the effects caused by the secondary displacements.
The purpose of this report is to assess quantitatively what is the probability that a fracture
of a specific size would intersect planned canister positions by using the latest DFN model
of Olkiluoto (Posiva WR 2017-32) and repository layout described in the TURVA-2020
Initial State report. The report presents a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of such
situations occurring over the repository footprint and at individual deposition holes. The
assessment is based on the description of the bedrock fracture systems at Olkiluoto and
therefore the report also includes a description of the fracture system as given in the latest
discrete fracture network (DFN) model (Posiva WR 2017-32).},

For this, the fracture characterization to generate Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) can take advantage of analogue outcrops through Virtual Outcrop Models (VOMs), acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and digital photogrammetry. The stochastic DFN generation is an important step in reservoir modeling as it brings more representative data to the process and has long been studied. However, optimizations concerning automatizing some of the steps necessary to its generation like data clustering are still open to advancements. In this sense, this work aims the fracture data clustering and the deﬁnition of the number of clusters when gathering data for the stochastic process, developing an Elbow method for spherical data and a balanced K-means, both based on Fisher statistics. For this, we interpreted fracture planes in a VOM that recreates a carbonate reservoir analogue from the Jandaíra Formation, in the Northeast, Brazil. As result, we show a workﬂow for immersive fracture interpretation alongside a 3D stochastic DFN model with fracture intensity of 22.57m−1 for cell sizes of 1m3. Regarding the clustering balance, our method achieved a lower standard deviation between sets while maintaining the Fisher values greater to obtain fracture sets with lower dispersion. Additionally, the Elbow method implementation proved a beneﬁcial step to the workﬂow as it reduced the interpretation bias of family clusters. These results alongside the proposed workﬂow bring a better understanding of the outcrop geometry while offering data scalability for reservoir modeling.},

The use of remote sensing, with progressive development of image enhancement techniques, provides an opportunity to produce more reliable and comprehensive lineament maps. In this paper, we propose the application of a semi-automatic approach based on digital terrain models (DTMs) for the extraction of potential lineaments and their detailed validation. We selected an area belonging to the Bagni di Vinadio municipality (Cuneo, NW Italy), which is part of the Argentera Massif (western Alps), as a test site. Data obtained from the code CurvaTool, developed by the authors, are successfully compared with literature information and with lineaments obtained from visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery. The CurvaTool code permits the extraction and classiﬁcation of a greater number of linear features compared to visual interpretation techniques. The ability to detect features that are not perceptible by visual observation is a strong point of CurvaTool processing. In the test area, CurvaTool output data correlate with visually detected linear features and show a good correlation with regional tectonics and iso-kinematic maps from the literature.},

	url = {https://tupa.gtk.fi/julkaisu/specialpaper/sp_057.pdf},
	abstract = {Structural interpretation is an essential part of a mineral exploration project because the genesis of many mineralization types is controlled by bedrock structures.
The objective of this study was to detect weakness and deformation zones of bedrock on a regional scale from remotely sensed magnetic and digital elevation datasets. Firstly, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is introduced in the detection
of local elongated minima from aeromagnetic data, the most commonly used data
in regional structural interpretation in Finland. Secondly, visual lineament interpretation results of the magnetic data and high-resolution digital elevation model
acquired by laser scanning are presented from the Enontekiö study area in NW Finland. Finally, the lineament detection processes are reviewed against the literature.
An OBIA algorithm called the Object-Based Lineament Detection (OBLD) implemented in eCognition software was developed with Cognitive Network Language
(CNL) to delineate continuous tilt derivative (TDR) minima for pattern recognition
of the weakness zones from aeromagnetic data. The success of the method relies on
line extraction raster filtering. However, the algorithm is not quite as sensitive in
finding local minima of TDR as curvature analysis (Phillips et al. 2007) for detecting edges from potential field data. The results of this paper also imply that visual
interpretation cannot currently be excluded or replaced by semi-automated image
processing techniques in the lineament detection of gridded geophysical or topographic data. Visual interpretation and pattern recognition-based lineament detection methods should be considered complementary rather than exclusive, although
pattern recognition methods provide a more objective first-pass interpretation of
lineaments compared to visual techniques. Further work in lineament detection
in mineral exploration should focus on applying both new and established pattern
recognition methods, gearing towards the use of a variety of geophysical and remotely sensed data sources, and the representation of these results as an integrated
lineament interpretation approach for evaluation and interpretation by structural
geologists.},

	abstract = {The NASA InSight mission to Mars successfully landed on 26 November 2018 in Elysium Planitia. It aims to characterize the seismic activity and aid in the understanding of the internal structure of Mars. We focus on the Cerberus Fossae region, a giant fracture network ∼1,200 km long situated east of the InSight landing site where M ∼3 marsquakes were detected during the past 2 years. It is formed of five main fossae located on the southeast of the Elysium Mons volcanic rise. We perform a detailed mapping of the entire system based on high-resolution satellite images and Digital Elevation Models. The refined cartography reveals a range of morphologies associated with dike activity at depth. Width and throw measurements of the fossae are linearly correlated, suggesting a possible tectonic control on the shapes of the fossae. Widths and throws decrease toward the east, indicating the long-term direction of propagation of the dike-induced graben system. They also give insights into the geometry at depth and how the possible faults and fractures are rooted in the crust. The exceptional preservation of the fossae allows us to detect up to four scales of segmentation, each formed by a similar number of 3–4 segments/subsegments. This generic distribution is comparable to continental faults and fractures on Earth. We anticipate higher stress and potential marsquakes within intersegment zones and at graben tips.},

	abstract = {The Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian crust in southern and central Fennoscandia was established about 1.8 Ga ago after a prolonged history of accretion and intrusion. During late stages of the Svecofennian orogeny, deformation was partitioned into several crustal-scale shear zones in present-day Finland, Sweden and Estonia. One such major ductile deformation zone, ‘the South Finland shear zone’ (SFSZ) extends for almost 200 km through the A˚ land archipelago in southwestern Finland, and further along the southern and southwestern coast of Finland. This more than a kilometer wide transpressional zone appears to have been repeatedly reactivated. The deformation started with a period of regional, ductile dextral shearing of igneous rocks, producing striped granodioritic and tonalitic gneisses. The ductile phases are locally overprinted and followed by ductile to semi-ductile deformation evidenced by mylonite zones of variable width. The last stage of tectonic activity along the shear zone is recorded by pseudotachylites. Within this study, we dated zircons (SIMS U–Pb) and titanites (ID-TIMS U–Pb) from eight rock samples, and two pseudotachylite whole-rock samples (40Ar/39Ar) in order to reconstruct the deformation and (re)activation history of the shear zone.},

	abstract = {The energy sector is undergoing a fundamental transformation, with a significant investment in low-carbon technologies to replace fossil-based systems. In densely populated urban areas, deep boreholes offer an alternative over shallow geothermal systems, which demand extensive surface areas to attain large-scale heat production. This paper presents numerical calculations of the thermal energy that can be extracted from the mediumdeep borehole heat exchangers in the low-enthalpy geothermal setting at depths ranging from 600 to 3000 m. We applied the thermogeological parameters of three locations across Finland and tested two types of coaxial borehole heat exchangers to understand better the variables that affect heat production in low-permeability crystalline rocks. For each depth, location, and heat collector type, we used a range of fluid flow rates to examine the correlation between thermal energy production and resulting outlet temperature. Our results indicate a trade-off between thermal energy production and outlet fluid temperature depending on the fluid flow rate, and that the vacuum-insulated tubing outperforms a high-density polyethylene pipe in energy and temperature production. In addition, the results suggest that the local thermogeological factors impact heat production. Maximum energy production from a 600-m-deep well achieved 170 MWh/a, increasing to 330 MWh/a from a 1000-m-deep well, 980 MWh/a from a 2-km-deep well, and up to 1880 MWh/a from a 3-km-deep well. We demonstrate that understanding the interplay of the local geology, heat exchanger materials, and fluid circulation rates is necessary to maximize the potential of medium-deep geothermal boreholes as a reliable long-term baseload energy source.},

These fracture networks were analyzed geometrically using Matrix Laboratory ­(MATLABTM)-Fracture Pattern Quantification ­(FRACPAQTM) software, which provided some insights. Fracture networks were portrayed as maps and graphs with a sequence of branches depicting fracture tracks and intersection indicating their discontinuations and interactions. The results of the estimated intensity-density, slip-dilation tendency, and the fracture interactions (permeability) signify that due to the moderate proportion of X-Y nodes in the study area, it has rendered the area to be of moderate connectivity and prospect. Geological exploration programs for minerals, groundwater, and environmental pollution studies should, therefore, carefully focus on these major fractural trends (i.e., NW-SE and NNW-SSE), because both geologic and geometric analyses have unraveled the potential of these fracture networks as reservoir rocks.},

In addition, several rock slopes of the Southern Cross-Island Highway in Taiwan were selected as the case study examples. After determining the slope rock mass quality estimates for each cases, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was used to classify those that are stable or not, and the discriminant functions which can determine failure probability of rock slopes were carried out by the LDA procedure. Afterward, the results may be compared with slope unstable hazards occurring actually, and then the relation and difference between them were discussed. Results show that the proposed method can be used to assess the stability of rock slopes according to the rock mass classification procedure and the failure probability in the early stage.},

The goal of the present study is to determine potential sites of larger (М ≥ 7.0) earthquakes in the region. This was done using the methodology designed for identification of sites of possible large earthquakes. The earthquake-generating features are considered to be intersections of morphostructural lineaments as identified by morphostructural zoning. The epicenters of М ≥ 7.0 earthquakes correlate with lineament intersections. The Kora-3 pattern recognition algorithm was used to separate all intersections in the region into highand low-seismicity ones with respect to М ≥ 7.0 based on the geological and geomorphologic parameters that characterize vicinities of intersections. The result was to recognize 150 intersections as having potential for М ≥ 7.0 earthquakes of a total of 510 intersections that were found in the region by morphostructural zoning. All of these intersections are within mountain belts. No intersections that can generate М ≥ 7.0 earthquakes have been identified in the intermontane troughs and within the southern Caspian deep-sea basin, whose crust is thinner. According to the geological and geomorphologic features of high seismicity intersections, as identified here, they are characterized by high contrasts in neotectonic movements and increased crustal fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Faults represent a critical heterogeneity in basaltic sequences, yet few studies have focused on their architectural and hydromechanical evolution. We present a detailed, multi-scale characterization of passively exhumed fault zones from the layered basalts of the Faroe Islands, which reveals cyclic stages of fault evolution. Outcrop-s cale structures and fault rock distribution within the fault zones were mapped in the field and in 3-D virtual outcrop models, with detailed characterization of fault rock microstructure obtained from optical and scanning electron microscopy. The fault zones record deformation localization from decameter-wide Riedel shear zones into meter-wide fault cores that contain multiple cataclastic shear bands and low-strain lenses organized around a central slip zone. Shear bands and the slip zone consist of (ultra-) cataclasites with a zeolite-smectite assemblage replacing the original plagioclase-pyroxene host rock composition. Low-strain lenses are breccias of weakly altered host rock or reworked fault rocks. Slip zone-p roximal zones show significant late-stage dilatation in the form of hydrothermal breccias or tabular veins with up to decimeter apertures. We interpret these structures as evolving from alternating shear-compaction and dilation through hydro­ fracture. The fault core preserves slip zone reworking, which is interpreted to indicate repeated shear zone locking and migration. The alternating deformation styles of shear-compaction and dilatation suggest episodic changes in deformation mechanisms driven by transient overpressure and release. The fault zone mechanical properties are thus governed by the combined effects of permanent chemical weakening and transient fluid-mediated mechanical weakening, alternating with cementation and healing. We suggest that the model presented for fault evolution should apply widely to shallow, basalthosted fault zones.},

	abstract = {We quantify the spatial distribution of fracture networks throughout six in situ X-ray tomography triaxial compression experiments on crystalline rocks at conﬁning stresses of 5–35 MPa in order to quantify how fracture development controls the ﬁnal macroscopic failure of the rock, a process analogous to those that control geohazards such as earthquakes and landslides. Tracking the proportion of the cumulative volume of fractures with volumes {\textgreater}90th percentile to the total fracture volume, v90/vtot indicates that the fracture networks tend to increase in localization toward these largest fractures for up to 80\% of the applied differential stress. The evolution of this metric also matches the evolution of the Gini coefﬁcient, which measures the deviation of a population from uniformity. These results are consistent with observations of localizing low magnitude seismicity before large earthquakes in southern California. In both this analysis and the present work, phases of delocalization interrupt the general increase in localization preceding catastrophic failure, indicating that delocalization does not necessarily indicate a reduction of seismic hazard. However, the proportion of the maximum fracture volume to the total fracture volume does not increase monotonically. Experiments with higher conﬁning stress tend to experience greater localization. To further quantify localization, we compare the geometry of the largest fractures, with volumes {\textgreater}90th percentile, to the best ﬁt plane through these fractures immediately preceding failure. The r2 scores and the mean distance of the fractures to the plane indicate greater localization in monzonite than in granite. The smaller mean mineral diameter and lower conﬁning stress in the granite experiments may contribute to this result. Tracking these various metrics of localization reveals a close association between macroscopic yielding and the acceleration of fracture network localization. Near yielding, v90/vtot and the Gini coefﬁcient increase while the mean distance to the ﬁnal failure plane decreases. Macroscopic yielding thus occurs when the rate of fracture network localization increases.},

	abstract = {The multiscale analysis of lineament patterns helps deﬁne the geometric scaling laws and the relationships between outcrop- and regional-scale structures in a fracture network. Here, we present a novel analytical and statistical workﬂow to analyze the geometrical and spatial organization properties of the Rolvsnes granodiorite lineament (fracture) network in the crystalline basement of southwestern Norway (Bømlo Island). The network shows a scaleinvariant spatial distribution described by a fractal dimension D ≈ 1.51, with lineament lengths distributed following a general scaling power law (exponent α = 1.88). However, orientation-dependent analyses show that the identiﬁed sets vary their relative abundance and spatial organization and occupancy with scale, deﬁning a hierarchical network. Lineament length, density, and intensity distributions of each set follow power-law scaling laws characterized by their own exponents. Thus, our multiscale, orientation-dependent statistical approach can aid in the identiﬁcation of the hierarchical structure of the fracture network, quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of lineament sets and their related regionalvs. local-scale relevance. These results, integrated with ﬁeld petrophysical analyses of fracture lineaments, can effectively improve the detail and accuracy of permeability prediction of heterogeneously fractured media. Our results also show how the geological and geometrical properties of the fracture network and analytical biases affect the results of multiscale analyses and how they must be critically assessed before extrapolating the conclusions to any other similar case study of fractured crystalline basement blocks.},

In Finland and China, the tectonic setting was incipient, aborted rifting of Paleoproterozoic or Archean continental crust, in Namibia it was continental rifting and mantle plume activity that led to the opening of southern Atlantic at {\textasciitilde}130 Ma. The 20–15 Ma granites of southern Nevada were related to rifting that followed the Triassic–Paleogene subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the southwestern United States. In all cases, extension-related magmatism was bimodal and accompanied by swarms of diabase and rhyolite–quartz latite dikes. Rapakivi texture with plagioclase-mantled alkali feldspar megacrysts occurs in varying amounts in the granites, and the latest intrusive phases are commonly topaz-bearing granites or rhyolites that may host tin, tungsten, and beryllium mineralization. The granites are typically ferroan alkali-calcic metaluminous to slightly peraluminous rocks with A-type and within-plate geochemical and mineralogical characteristics. Isotope studies (Nd, Sr) suggest dominant crustal sources for the granites. The preferred genetic model is magmatic underplating involving dehydration melting of intermediate-felsic deep crust. Juvenile mafic magma was incorporated either via magma mingling and mixing, or by remelting of newly hybridized lower crust. In Namibia, partial melting of subcontinental lithospheric mantle was caused by the Tristan mantle plume, in the other cases the origin of the mantle magmatism is controversial. For the Fennoscandian suites, extensive long-time mantle upwelling associated with periodic, migrating melting of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, governed by heat flow and deep crustal structures, is suggested.},

	abstract = {Brittle structures describe the upper crustal deformation, and local cracks and faults
observed in the bedrock represent parts of the fracture system and regional tectonic
evolution. The formation of fracture systems occurs due to stress applied to the bedrock,
leading to different directions and movements of fractures. Furthermore, the stress
tensors correlate with the bedrock lineaments and fractures and form fracture systems of
different formation generations and orientations. Structural geological mapping with a
paleostress interpretation hence analyses the kinematic and age relationships of the
brittle fracture system and faults and their association to past or current tectonic
processes.
This study aims to provide a structural geological framework of the Boxö-Vårdö zone,
located in northeastern Åland. The Boxö-Vårdö zone is interpreted as a continuation of
the northwest-trending South Finland Shear Zone. The Boxö-Vårdö zone has therefore
been interpreted as a lineament, forming a northern extension to the shear zone.
Patterns between lineament features, regional fractures and fault data have been studied
between four domains, and the chronological narrative of the fracture system between
the domains was analysed. In addition, the relationship between the structural data from
the study area and the SFSZ was examined.
Faults, as well as fracture systems, are often formed as linear shapes in the bedrock.
Lineaments were digitised from Light Detection And Ranging, bathymetry and satellite
maps and regional fractures were digitised from drone images. Field measurements were
conducted to support the digitisation and interpretation of lineaments, regional fractures
and faults. Observations of similarities between structure directions and kinematics in

	abstract = {The southern Finnish mainland, Aland, the Gulf of Finland and parts of
neighbouring Latvia, Estonia and Russia are classical rapakivi areas. A typical
rapakivi (adopted Finnish word meaning ''rotten stone”) is a coarse-grained
granite with alkali feldspar ovoids either surrounded by plagioclase mantles
(wiborgite) or not (pyterlite). Some other associated granite types (porphyritic
with idiomorphic phenocrysts, equigranular and aplitic) are called also rapakivi.
The granitic melt of the rapakivi plutons originated from partial melting of
lower crust (a mixture of Archaean and Proterozoic lower crust in the Salmi and
Ulyalegi plutons and Proterozoic in all the others) whereas the gabbro - anortho-
sites and diabases represent partial melting of the subcontinental mantle. These
conclusions are largely based on isotopic studies. The rapakivi granites o f the
map area comprise three isotopic age groups: 1620-1650 M a (SE Finland and
Estonia), 1540-1590 Ma (SW Finland and Latvia) and 1540-1560 Ma (Russian
Karelia).
Gabbros and anorthosites make up the southern part o f the Riga rapakivi
pluton, the eastern part o f the Salmi pluton and the surroundings of the Ahve-
nisto pluton. There are smaller bodies of mafic plutonic rocks in many other
places, e.g ., the Abja pluton of southern Estonia and the gem-quality anorthosite
(spectrolite) of Ylamaa, Vyborg batholith.
There are several swarms of diabase dykes within the rapakivi areas; some
swarms are more than 150 km long. Most of these diabases are slightly older
than the rapakivi granites and their emplacement was probably connected to the
upward movement of rapakivi granite magma in the crust. The trends of the dyke
swarms show the directions of maximum stress during rapakivi intrusion.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            The 1·65–1·54 Ga rapakivi granites of southeastern Fennoscandia represent the silicic members of a bimodal magmatic association in which the mafic members are tholeiitic diabase dykes and minor gabbroic-anorthositic bodies. They are metaluminous to slightly peraluminous A-type granites and occur as high-level batholiths and stocks in an E-W-trending belt extending from Soviet Karelia to southwestern Finland. The Soviet Karelian granites were emplaced into the contact zone between Archaean craton and Svecofennian juvenile 1·9Ga-old crust, while the Finnish granites were intruded into the Svecofennian crust. Deep seismic soundings show that the rapakivi granites and the contemporaneous, mainly WNW or NW-trending diabase dyke swarms are situated in a zone of relatively thin crust. Below the Wiborg Batholith there exists a domal structure in the lithosphere in which a transitional zone (mafic underplate) occurs between the crust and the mantle.
            
              The Nd isotopic evolution of the rapakivi granites (ε
              Nd
              (T) −3·1—−0·2) corresponds to the evolution of the 1·9Ga-old Svecofennian crust, as do their Pb isotopic compositions. This implies that the Finnish granites represent anatectic melts of the Svecofennian crust. In contrast, the Soviet Karelian granites show isotopic composition indicative of substantial incorporation of Archaean lower crust material. Petrochemical modelling of one of the Finnish batholiths shows that its parental magma could have been generated by
              c.
              20\% melting of a granodioritic source and that fractional crystallisation was important during the subsequent evolution of this magma.
            
            The rapakivi granites are redefined as A-type granites that show the rapakivi texture at least in larger batholiths. The field, geochemical, and seismic data indicate that the classical Finnish rapakivi granites were generated in an anorogenic extensional regime by partial melting of the lower/middle crust. The melting, and possibly also the extensional tectonics, were related to upwellings of hot mantle material which led to intrusion of mafic magmas at the base and into the crust.},

	abstract = {Quarrying and abrasion are the two principal processes responsible for glacial erosion of bedrock. The morphologies of glacier hard beds depend on the relative effectiveness of these two processes, as abrasion tends to smooth bedrock surfaces and quarrying tends to roughen them. Here we analyze concentrations of bedrock discontinuities in the Tsanfleuron forefield, Switzerland, to help determine the geologic conditions that favor glacial quarrying over abrasion. Aerial discontinuity concentrations are measured from scaled drone-based photos where fractures and bedding planes in the bedrock are manually mapped. A Tukey honest significant difference test indicates that aerial concentration of bed-normal bedrock discontinuities is not significantly different between quarried and non-quarried areas of the forefield. Thus, an alternative explanation is needed to account for the spatial variability of quarried areas. To investigate the role that bedparallel discontinuities might play in quarrying, we use a finite element model to simulate bed-normal fracture propagation within a stepped bed with different step heights. Results indicate that higher steps (larger spacing of bed-parallel discontinuities) propagate bed-normal fractures more readily than smaller steps. Thus, the spacing of bed-parallel discontinuities could exert strong control on quarrying by determining the rate that blocks can be loosened from the host rock.},

	abstract = {Rapakivi granites and the associated suite (anorthosite, mangerite and charnockite) that developed during the Mid-Proterozoic escape the global rules that control usual granitic magma formation. About 40 points that characterise the Proterozoic magmatism conﬁrm the originality of the magmatism. Rapakivi granites developed without a global orogenic context within the supercontinent Columbia. The intrusions extend from the East European shield to the western US, through Fennoscandia, Greenland and Labrador. Other occurrences in the Amazonian shield, Australia or South China are less well documented. They show no deﬁnite trend in age or chemistry that would explain large-scale (mantle plume) effects. A mantle upwelling of material is contradictory with the re-assembly of a supercontinent because it occurred before this magmatic episode (1.9–1.8 Ga). At ∼1.7 Ga, the supercontinent Columbia amalgamated with the collision of the Yapavai and Mazatzal Provinces. A model is suggested that takes into account the supercontinent re-assembly, deﬁning a downwelling ﬂow in the mantle that anchors the continent above it. In contrast to a material ﬂow, heat is still delivered to the base of the continental lithosphere, and is focused toward the juvenile suture zone. The base of the crust must reach 1200–1300 ◦C before producing anorthosite magmas. Under such a high temperature gradient lasting over a long time, magmas are transferred toward the upper crust, giving the thin (5 km) and square-shape (100 km) that the intrusions presently have. Heat delivery is essentially conductive, leading to long time-spans for intrusions. The presence of the supercontinent, immobile over a descending cell (poloidal mode of convection) developed a tangential force (toroidal mode of convection) that partly split the continent through strike–slip deformation due to plate rotation. It developed progressively between 1.57 and 1.3 Ga, starting from Fennoscandia, and then passing to Amazonia, western US and Labrador in a clockwise sense. The associated rotation induced sinistral shear manifested by small-scale shear zones and the orientation of late magmatic facies (topaz-bearing granites) in each province. The Proterozoic magmatism appears to be unique because it requires a supercontinent with a zone of juvenile crust surrounded by older cratons. The present Moho still shows remnants of this process, having bumpy undulations that may reach 22 km in amplitude over a distance of 200 km.},

In particular, several existing discretization approaches for fractured porous media can be seen as special instances of the approach proposed herein. We provide an abstract stability theory for our approach, which provides explicit guidance into the grids used to discretize the fractures and the porous medium, as dependent on discretization methods chosen for the respective domains. The theoretical results are sustained by numerical examples, wherein we utilize our framework to simulate flow in 2D and 3D fractured media using control volume methods (both two- and multi-point flux), Lagrangian finite element methods, mixed finite element methods, and virtual element methods. As expected, regardless of the ambient methods chosen, our approach leads to stable and convergent discretizations for the fractured problems considered, within the limits of the discretization schemes.},

Microstructurally-constrained K–Ar data from cohesive damage zone samples are compared to bulk K–Ar data from fault gouges from the adjacent fault cores. In Fault I, fluid ingress along the fault core caused pervasive alteration of the host granodiorite. Plagioclase and biotite are almost completely altered to kaolinite, quartz, illite and smectite. In Fault II, a complex deformation history is recorded by multiple fault rock microdomains, including an ultracataclasite with {\textgreater} 50\% authigenic illite and an illite/jarosite-bearing pseudotachylyte. Microdomains hosting authigenic illite ( ± jarosite) from both studied faults were separated, characterized mineralogically and dated by K–Ar. Results confirm that each domain contains only one generation of authigenic illite ( ± jarosite), and provide robust time constraints on fault initiation in the Carboniferous (339 ± 8 Ma) and reactivation in the Permian (289 ± 6 Ma). K–Ar geochronology of the adjacent fault gouges yields inclined age-versus-grain-size relationships. The ages of the coarsest grain size fractions are similar to the age range of the damage zone data, whereas the ages of the finer fractions are significantly younger. Our study provides new and important insights into the dynamics of longlived fault zones: Isotopic signatures and structural features representative of fault initiation are preserved in the damage zones, while they are progressively overprinted due to cumulative strain localization in the fault cores. Finally, our study further clarifies the significance of ‘age plateaus’ in age-versus-grain-size plots, which allows for a robust and geologically meaningful interpretation of K–Ar data.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Using examples of regional opening-mode fractures in sandstones from the Cambrian Flathead Formation, Wyoming, we show that quartz deposits preferentially fill fractures up to ca. 0.05 mm wide and fractures transition from being mostly sealed to mostly open over a narrow size range of opening displacements from 0.05 to 0.1 mm. In our example, although isolated (I-node) dominated networks have some trace connectivity, the effective connectivity for fluid flow is likely greatly reduced by quartz cementation. Trace connectivity at microscopic and outcrop scale is similar, but most porosity is found in outcrop-scale fractures. Near faults, trace connectivity increases as initially wide porous fractures preferentially shear and wing cracks form, increasing fracture intersections (Y-nodes). However, pore 17 space is lost due to the development of microbreccia. Macro-scale trace connectivity increases, but porous 18 connectivity diminishes and thus potential for fluid flow is markedly lower. Connectivity descriptions 19 should include accurate measures of widths and lengths and use nodes that reflect scale and diagenesis. 20 We propose new rule-based node descriptions to measure diagenesis sensitive connections within the 21 context of current field practices. Under diagenetic conditions between ca. 50 ℃ to 250 ℃ differential 22 infill makes network porosity, and thus permeability and strength, scale dependent.},

	abstract = {After a nuclear waste container buried 500–1,000 m underground, it gradually experiences the dual effects of groundwater inﬁltration and the decay heat of radioactive nuclear waste. The decay and heat release of nuclear waste will also result in temperature stress. At the same time, the groundwater will gradually saturate the buffer/backﬁll materials which will produce expansion stress, thus forming a typical thermal–water–stress multi-coupling environment in the geological disposal, forming the environment where the corrosion could happen. In comparison, the information obtained through laboratories, ﬁeld tests, and natural simulations are limited. However, numerical simulation is very important to predict the changes of a near-ﬁeld environment. On one hand, the numerical simulation can verify the corresponding experimental data in the early stages; on the other hand, it can also predict the long-term corrosion environment change. This article mainly summarizes the large-scale evolution of a typical corrosion environment obtained by numerical simulation under different deep geological conditions in various countries, focusing on the effects of temperature, saturation, oxygen content, and radiation, which provide a reference for the research on the evolution of important corrosion environments on the surface of a nuclear waste container.},

	abstract = {Analysis of tectonic stress from the inversion of fault kinematic and earthquake focal mechanism data is routinely done using a wide variety of direct inversion, iterative and grid search methods. This paper discusses important aspects and new developments of the stress inversion methodology as the critical evaluation and interpretation of the results. The problems of data selection and separation into subsets, choice of optimization function, and the use of non-fault structural elements in stress inversion (tension, shear and compression fractures) are examined. The classical Right Dihedron method is developed in order to estimate the stress ratio R, widen its applicability to compression and tension fractures, and provide a compatibility test for data selection and separation. A new Rotational Optimization procedure for interactive kinematic data separation of fault-slip and focal mechanism data and progressive stress tensor optimization is presented. The quality assessment procedure defined for the World Stress Map project is extended in order to take into account the diversity of orientations of structural data used in the inversion. The range of stress regimes is expressed by a stress regime index R', useful for regional comparisons and mapping, All these aspects have been implemented in a computer program TENSOR, which is introduced briefly. The procedures for determination of stress tensor using these new aspects are described using natural sets of fault-slip and focal mechanism data from the Baikal Rift Zone.},

Accordingly, migmatites typically show a genetic linkage between the tectonic deformation and melt migration. We investigated this relationship in Olkiluoto (SW Finland) and identified four phases of ductile deformation, which are distinguished by the multiple folding phases, ductile shear events and cross-cutting features associated with pegmatitic leucosomes and/or a specific type of diatexitic migmatite with feldspar megacrysts. U–Pb LA-MC-ICPMS data on zircon cores and rims from migmatites and cross-cutting pegmatites indicate two distinct metamorphic events associated with melt generation and migration at 1.87–1.84 Ga and 1.82–1.78 Ga. These two migmatitic events suggest that the orogenic evolution of the area was long-lasting and characterized by slow cooling. The structural data and the age constraints presented in this paper support the idea of similar tectonic evolution and metamorphic environment in SW Finland and central E Sweden.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the framework and open-source software code to train and apply Deep Learning Con­ volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the prediction of geological lineaments using topographic, magnetic, and gravity raster data. Many important applications relate to the recognition of linear geological structures from remote sensing data, such as thrust faults, bedrock fault and shear zones, lithological contacts, fractures and fold structures. The digitization of fault lineaments is conventionally performed by geologists or geophysicists with working knowledge of the relevant data, e.g., topographic Digital Elevation Model, magnetic data, and gravity data. Visual inspection and extraction is simple but subjective; the process is also time-expensive with efficiency and accuracy depending on the individual’s knowledge, experience, and skill. For decades there has been interest in ways to automate this process. Our CNN approach is trained using publicly available lineament GIS data from the Quest BC project in British Columbia, Canada, and the Loch Lilly-Kars area of New South Wales, Australia. The datasets used to train the prediction models resulted in interesting predictions proximal to the training areas: some major lineaments are indicated, some are missed, and potential new (valid) lineaments are indicated. The results indicate potential for use as a semi-automated lineament detection solution. In contrast, but as antici­ pated, application of the model to the blind-test area of the Swayze greenstone belt, Ontario, produced poor lineament prediction results (as compared to publicly available interpretations). We interpret this result as related to insufficiently large training data inputs. However, it is inferred that results could be improved through feature engineering (e.g., use of topographic slope, rather than simply elevation) without the need to simply create larger training datasets. We hope that, by making the code open-source, the geoscience community will use this platform to gradually improve an open source fault prediction model.},

	abstract = {Indonesia has high geothermal potential comprising 40\% of the world’s potential geothermal energy, volcanic and non-volcanic systems. Volcanic systems have wit‑nessed more exploration activities for geothermal resources compared to non-volcanic systems. A high potential non-volcanic system in Indonesia is located in the northern part of Konawe, Southeast Sulawesi. Previous research had identified surface tem‑perature anomaly (high temperature) and some surface manifestations for this area, specifically in the northeast part of Wawolesea. However, the source of surface mani‑festations and permeable zones as an implication of a good reservoir are still unknown. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the permeable zones and geothermal potential in the non-volcanic geothermal system of north Wawolesea by applying line‑aments analysis and the fault fracture density (FFD) method. A total of 1694 major and minor lineaments were manually delineated using ArcGIS based on Digital Elevation Model Nasional (DEMNAS). FFD map and rose diagrams displayed the orientation of all lineaments and structures with the major lineaments trending NNE–SSW, whereas the minor lineaments showed irregular distribution and orientation. Field measurements also show the same azimuth orientation for the mapped fractures. Five zones were characterized by high FFD values (2.81–4.54 km/km2). One of the extensively fractured zones (Zone C) is located between Meluhu and Lembo, covering an area of around 19.39 ­km2. This area is interpreted to be highly permeable and suggestive of a recharge area that contributes to surface manifestation in the Wawolesea. Therefore, the area between Meluhu and Lembo in the northern part of Konawe shows high geother‑mal potential due to its planar morphology and high FFD values. This study allows an improved understanding of how fracture geometry, distribution and density control the permeability in geothermal reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Data science (digitalisation and artificial intelligence) became more than an important facilitator for many domains in fundamental and applied sciences as well as industry and is disrupting the way of research already to a large extent. Originally, data sciences were viewed to be well-suited, especially, for data-intensive applications such as image processing, pattern recognition, etc. In the recent past, particularly, data-driven and physics-inspired machine learning methods have been developed to an extent that they accelerate numerical simulations and became directly usable for applications related to the nuclear waste management cycle. In addition to process-based approaches for creating surrogate models, other disciplines such as virtual reality methods and high-performance computing are leveraging the potential of data sciences more and more. The present challenge is utilising the best models, input data and monitoring information to integrate multi-chemical-physical, coupled processes, multi-scale and probabilistic simulations in Digital Twins (DTw) able to mirror or predict the performance of its corresponding physical twins. Therefore, the main target of the Topical Collection is exploring how the development of DTw can benefit the development of safe, efficient solutions for the pre-disposal and disposal of radioactive waste. A particular challenge for DTw in radioactive waste management is the combination of concepts from geological modelling and underground construction which will be addressed by linking structural and multi-physics/chemistry process models to building or tunnel information models. As for technical systems, engineered structures a variety of DTw approaches already exist, the development of DTw concepts for geological systems poses a particular challenge when taking the complexities (structures and processes) and uncertainties at extremely varying time and spatial scales of subsurface environments into account.},

	abstract = {Groundwater flow in sparsely fractured crystalline rocks is highly channelized due to the existing complex hydrogeological heterogeneity in fracture networks. The impacts of multiscale hydraulic heterogeneity on channelized flow in a block of fractured rock under the unidirectional flow condition are investigated by three-dimensional (3D) discrete fracture network (DFN) modeling. A channel network (CN) model generated from DFN is used to model the channelized groundwater flow in fractured crystalline rock. An approach for parameterizing the channel conductance is proposed which uses information from the hydrogeological characterization data. The results show that the network scale hydrogeological heterogeneity dominates the distribution variability of flowrates. The proposed parameterization approach for the channel conductance is effective and robust. Based on the available hydrogeological characterization data, it is possible to compensate for the neglected heterogeneity in the CN model by enhancing the variability of assigned channel conductance. The findings from this work are useful for model simplification from 3D DFN to CN, and for overcoming the difficulty in the parameterization of CN models in applications.},

towards deployment. Requirements for the geological characterization of nuclear facility

SMRs in Finland, investigations into SMR-related geological aspects can only be conducted
using applicable literature and previous research concerning conventional NPPs.
Finland is currently the only country in the world to successfully build a repository site for
spent nuclear fuel and is advancing towards final disposal operations. The construction of
nuclear power plants also has a longstanding tradition in the country, with two nuclear
power plant sites successfully built and multiple reactors in operation.
The goal of this report is to discuss introductory geological suitability criteria for siting SMR
power plants and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) repositories. This is done by applying existing
literature and knowledge of geological siting aspects to SMR technology in the siting process
for SMR power plants and SMR SNF repositories.
This report reviews the geological siting aspects, or geological suitability criteria, investigation methods and data needs that would be required in SMR power plant and repository
siting. It also considers some novel aspects related to nuclear waste strategies, especially
concerning centralized or decentralized strategy options for SMR-based waste. Deep borehole
disposal concepts and their relation to SMR-based waste are also preliminarily reviewed,
with special emphasis on Finnish bedrock conditions.

	abstract = {Abstract. The crystalline basement is considered a ubiquitous and almost inexhaustible source of geothermal energy in the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) and other regions worldwide. The hydraulic properties of the basement, which are one of the key factors in the productivity of geothermal power plants, are primarily controlled by hydraulically active faults and fractures. While the most accurate in situ information about the general fracture network is obtained from image logs of deep boreholes, such data are generally sparse and costly and thus often not openly accessible. To circumvent this problem, an outcrop analogue study was conducted with interdisciplinary geoscientific methods in the Tromm Granite, located in the southern Odenwald at the northeastern margin of the URG. Using light detection and ranging (lidar) scanning, the key characteristics of the fracture network were extracted in a total of five outcrops; these were additionally complemented by lineament analysis of two different digital elevation models (DEMs). Based on this, discrete fracture network (DFN) models were developed to calculate equivalent permeability tensors under assumed reservoir conditions. The influences of different parameters, such as fracture orientation, density, aperture and mineralization, were investigated. In addition, extensive gravity and radon measurements were carried out in the study area, allowing fault zones with naturally increased porosity and permeability to be mapped. Gravity anomalies served as input data for a stochastic density inversion, through which areas of potentially increased open porosity were identified. A laterally heterogeneous fracture network characterizes the Tromm Granite, with the highest natural permeabilities expected at the pluton margin, due to the influence of large shear and fault zones.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cracks are a key feature that determines the structural integrity of rocks, and their angular distribution can be used to determine the local or regional stress patterns. The temporal growth of cracks can be monitored in order to predict impending failures of materials or structures such as a weakened dam. Thus, cracks and their spatial-temporal distributions should be automatically monitored for assessing their structural integrity, the associated stress patterns and their potential for failure.
Method: We show that the U-Net convolutional neural network, semantic segmentation and transfer learning can be used to accurately detect cracks in drone photos of sedimentary massifs. In this case, the crack distributions are used to assess the safest areas for tunnel excavation. Compared to the coarse performance of ridge detection, the U-Net accuracy in identifying cracks in images can be as high as 98\% when evaluated against human identification, which is sufficient for assessing the general crack properties of the rock faces for the engineering project.
Result: Based on approximately 100 h of manual cracks labeling in 127 drone photos and 20 h of network training, the U-Net was able to successfully detect cracks in 23,845 high-resolution photographs in less than 22 h using two Nvidia V100 GPUs. Meanwhile, the network was able to detect more than 80\% of the observable cracks of a volcanic outcrop in Idaho without additional training. With a modest amount of extra labeling on photos of the volcanic outcrop and transfer training, we found that the accuracy significantly improved. The surprising outcome of this research is that the U-Net crack detector laboriously trained on photos of sedimentary rocks can also be effectively applied to photos of volcanic rock faces. This can be important for real-time assessment of geological hazards and lithology information for dam inspection and planetary exploration by autonomous vehicles. For another application, we accurately detected fractures and faults with a scale of tens of kilometers from Martian photographs.
Conclusions: In summary, our methodology of using CNN with transfer training suggests that it can be used as a semi-universal detector of cracks in across a range of diverse geological settings.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The permeability of fault zones plays a significant role on the distribution of georesources and on seismogenesis in the brittle upper crust, where both natural and induced seismicity are often associated with fluid migration and overpressure. Detailed models of the permeability structure of fault zones are thus necessary to refine our understanding of natural fluid pathways and of the mechanisms leading to fluid compartmentalization and possible overpressure in the crust. Fault zones commonly contain complex internal architectures defined by the spatial juxtaposition of “brittle structural facies” (BSF), which progressively and continuously form and evolve during faulting and deformation. We present the first systematic in-situ outcrop permeability measurements from a range of BSFs from two architecturally complex fault zones in the Northern Apennines (Italy). A stark spatial heterogeneity of the present-day permeability (up to four orders of magnitude) even for tightly juxtaposed BSFs belonging to the same fault emerges as a key structural and hydraulic feature. Insights from this study allow us to better understand how complex fault architectures steer the 3D hydraulic structure of the brittle upper crust. Fault hydraulic properties, which may change through space but also in time during an orogenesis and/or individual seismic cycles, in turn steer the development of overpressured volumes, where fluid-induced seismogenesis may localize.},

	abstract = {Fractured and weathered crystalline basement units below erosional unconformities potentially represent un­ conventional reservoirs for georesources (oil, mineral and water). The reservoir properties and characteristics strongly depend on secondary processes connected to the local structural and alteration/weathering history. Here we present the results of in–situ field quantification of mechanical (uniaxial compressive strength) and petrophysical (permeability) properties of a fractured and weathered crystalline basement at selected outcrops on the island of Bømlo (western Norway). The Bømlo outcrops are believed to represent an onshore analogue of the unconventional oil reservoir hosted in the offshore Utsira High granodioritic fractured basement (northern North Sea). The off– and onshore crystalline basements have both undergone surficial weathering during the Mesozoic, as shown by the occurrence of a dated, variably thick saprolitic profile on top of fresh fractured basement blocks. The Bømlo crystalline basement is characterized by a complex and highly permeable fracture network. Fault rocks within its fault zones are characterised by an anisotropic mechanical strength and by an average permeability that is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the host rock. The matrix permeability and mechanical strength are significantly affected by alteration/weathering products. Analysis of the textural and mineralogical characteristics of the weathered outcrops allowed us to constrain the variation of permeability and mechanical strength as a function of increasing alteration and to infer their distribution in the, now eroded, top–basement weathering profile on Bømlo. Weathering enhances permeability and drastically decreases the mechanical strength. Nevertheless, evolved saprolitic horizons may act as low–permeability top–seal units to the fractured and weathered crystalline basement reservoir. The obtained permeability and mechanical data are finally used to better constrain the potential reservoir rocks, the fluid migration pathways, and to discuss their role in the geomechanics of a conceptualised fractured and weathered crystalline basement unconventional reservoir.},

(2) Epidote, chlorite and quartz fault mineralizations indicate a dominant strike-slip stress field in the Late Devonian to early Carboniferous. (3) E-W extensional stress fields which could be related to Permo-Triassic or Late Jurassic rifting are not prominent in our data set.

	title = {Michigan {International} {Copper} {Analogue} ({MICA}) project – {Phase} {I}},
	abstract = {The long-term prediction of engineered barrier system materials is generally supported
by: demonstrating a mechanistic understanding of the degradation processes, conducting
large-scale in situ tests, and developing computer models. The study of analogues can be
used to support long-term predictions relevant for copper as part of waste canisters. Copper is an important part of many disposal concepts, e.g., KBS-3 developed in Sweden and
Finland and Mark II developed in Canada.
The Michigan International Copper Analogue (MICA) Project focuses on the general stability
of native copper in the world’s largest native copper dominated deposits of the Keweenaw
Peninsula native copper district in Michigan, U.S.A. One of the key requirements for the
deep geological disposal of high-level nuclear waste is the assessment of its long-term
performance and safety for upwards of one million years. Observations made from the
geological systems, i.e., natural analogues, can be utilized in the safety case and can provide
information far beyond one million years. Both natural and archaeological analogue studies
are reported in the literature, but only a few studies have focussed on the stability of native
copper within its natural setting. The goal of the MICA Project is to provide a unique data
source to describe natural analogue processes governing long-term corrosion behaviour of
the pure copper used in waste canisters. This information will support disposal safety cases
as well as stakeholder communications.
The Keweenaw Peninsula native copper district occurs within the ca. 1.1 billion years old
North American Midcontinent Rift system (MCR). Metamorphogenic ore-forming hydrothermal fluids precipitated native copper and associated minerals in primary and secondary open spaces of the host rocks at depth about 1.04 to 1.07 billion years ago. Subsequent
erosion resulted in exposure of the native copper deposits at the surface. The Keweenawan
deposits were commercially mined from 1845 to 1968.
Keweenaw Peninsula native copper occurrences have been mentioned as a qualitative source
of information to support the use of copper as part of nuclear waste canisters. However,
data on natural corrosion of native copper for geological disposal process-based safety assessments is lacking. In Phase I of the MICA Project, the combination of geologic setting
and geologic and environment history was used to group natural native copper occurrences
into several different potential analogues. For each potential analogue, the geologic history,
environmental condition, length of exposure, and uncertainties and assumptions are presented based on existing data. The feasibility of obtaining sufficient representative or new
samples with a reasonably high potential for being exposed to water have been assessed
for each analogue. Water is an essential component to initiate corrosion of native copper as
illustrated by native copper inclusions encased in calcite and other minerals which do not
show visible corrosion. Availability of supportive information such as estimates of water
composition is also evaluated. All these data have been reviewed against disposal concepts
and degradation processes. While all the analogues have the potential to provide insight
into corrosion of copper, some of the analogues are ranked to have higher potential than
others. Native copper encased in bedrock or minerals with limited to no exposure to waters provides a baseline analogue or background level of corrosion. A few of the corrosion
analogues identified as the most promising and relevant are:
1. Bedrock native copper with long and varied history – Cumulative corrosion under different probable conditions over time frames of up to 100s of millions of years and more
and at depths up to 2 km.
2. Cumulative corrosion observed in subaqueous Lake Superior native copper gravel and in
native copper in glacial deposited sediments.
3. Copper in clay – Bedrock native copper formed in situ in hydrothermal fracture-filling
clay.
4. Copper exposed to copper sulfides – bedrock native copper effected by sulfur-bearing
waters and native copper in contact with sulfide minerals.
The results from Phase I of the MICA Project provide a context and a starting point to further
investigate the corrosion of native copper samples during Phase II.},

In this study, we examine the application of Bing Maps imagery for fracture network analysis in the Kuh-e-Asmari anticline (Zagros Mountains, Iran), a scarcely vegetated area which is a good outcropping analogue for fractured reservoirs. Image-derived fracture characterisation is conducted at three distinct scales (1:50,000, 1:5,000 and 1:500) using the NetworkGT plugin in QGIS and was compared with structural data collected in the field (i.e. scan lines). The results reveal a scale dependency, with the advantages and disad­ vantages of each scale summarised as follows. The 1:50,000 is the only spatially continuous dataset. The 1:5,000 dataset, potentially spatially continuous, enables the analysis of fracture and connectivity distribution in great detail, emphasising strongly fractured/connected elongated zones, which may represent damage zones of known, previously mapped fault strands. The 1:500 scale does not ensure the spatial continuity of the dataset; however, similar to scan lines, it can perform detailed analyses of the fracture network in potentially interesting areas. We conclude that structural field surveys can be combined with multi-scale mapping on aerial images to better define the length and abundance distribution of fractures.},

              In crystalline bedrock, the open fraction of the fracture network constitutes the main pathways for fluids. Many observations point out that the state of stress influences the open fraction, likely indicating recent reactivation. But how this occurs is still unresolved.

In this study, 3-D hy­ dromechanical models were conducted to better understand the response of a natural fault intersected by a hydraulic fault under different stress regimes. A comprehensive parametric study was carried out to assess the roles of fluid pressure, burial depth, basin permeability, intersection angle, and horizontal differential stress on the hydromechanical response of a system containing two intersecting faults. Depending on basin sediment permeability, fault intersection angle, and horizontal differential stress, the fluid flow either stops, crosses, or diverts toward natural fault. Among the tested parameters, the intersection angle, and horizontal differential stress have the most noticeable effect on the fluid flow in the system. The critical intersection angle at which the fluid flow diverts toward the natural fault varies between ≈27◦ in normal faulting regimes, to ≈55◦, in both strike-slip and reverse faulting regimes. Conversely, burial depth and fluid pressure have no significant effect on fluid flow diversion in the intersection zone. The results are in agreement with field observations related to the unconformity-related uranium deposits found in northern Canada.},

            Environmental, social and governance pressures should feature in future scenario planning about the transition to a low carbon future. As low-carbon energy technologies advance, markets are driving demand for energy transition metals. Increased extraction rates will augment the stress placed on people and the environment in extractive locations. To quantify this stress, we develop a set of global composite environmental, social and governance indicators, and examine mining projects across 20 metal commodities to identify the co-occurrence of environmental, social and governance risk factors. Our findings show that 84\% of platinum resources and 70\% of cobalt resources are located in high-risk contexts. Reflecting heightened demand, major metals like iron and copper are set to disturb more land. Jurisdictions extracting energy transition metals in low-risk contexts are positioned to develop and maintain safeguards against mining-related social and environmental risk factors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cracks are a key feature that determines the structural integrity of rocks, and their angular distribution can be used to determine the local or regional stress patterns. The temporal growth of cracks can be monitored in order to predict impending failures of materials or structures such as a weakened dam. Thus, cracks and their spatial-temporal distributions should be automatically monitored for assessing their structural integrity, the associated stress patterns and their potential for failure.
Method: We show that the U-Net convolutional neural network, semantic segmentation and transfer learning can be used to accurately detect cracks in drone photos of sedimentary massifs. In this case, the crack distributions are used to assess the safest areas for tunnel excavation. Compared to the coarse performance of ridge detection, the U-Net accuracy in identifying cracks in images can be as high as 98\% when evaluated against human identification, which is sufficient for assessing the general crack properties of the rock faces for the engineering project.
Result: Based on approximately 100 h of manual cracks labeling in 127 drone photos and 20 h of network training, the U-Net was able to successfully detect cracks in 23,845 high-resolution photographs in less than 22 h using two Nvidia V100 GPUs. Meanwhile, the network was able to detect more than 80\% of the observable cracks of a volcanic outcrop in Idaho without additional training. With a modest amount of extra labeling on photos of the volcanic outcrop and transfer training, we found that the accuracy significantly improved. The surprising outcome of this research is that the U-Net crack detector laboriously trained on photos of sedimentary rocks can also be effectively applied to photos of volcanic rock faces. This can be important for real-time assessment of geological hazards and lithology information for dam inspection and planetary exploration by autonomous vehicles. For another application, we accurately detected fractures and faults with a scale of tens of kilometers from Martian photographs.
Conclusions: In summary, our methodology of using CNN with transfer training suggests that it can be used as a semi-universal detector of cracks in across a range of diverse geological settings.},

	abstract = {Drone use in geoscience research and teaching is becoming widespread, with diverse applications documented. Many studies favour consumer-level drones, however, recent developments in so-called “microdrones” (takeoff weight {\textless} 250 g) necessitate further investigation to determine possible beneﬁts, limitations, and future developments. Microdrone deployment is often advantageous in numerous jurisdictions due to fewer regulations, lower cost, and simple transportation. In this study, we deployed a DJI Mini 2 microdrone to study the ca. 201 Ma North Mountain Basalt (NMB) exposed in coastal outcrops along the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada. We report beneﬁts of the microdrone as a ﬁeld aid with three related approaches: (1) general site location and characterisation, (2) drone-based photogrammetry using ArcGIS Drone2Map, and (3) quantitative fracture mapping using FracPaQ. Application of these methods showed that microdrone-acquired imagery from the NMB exposures provides a valuable resource for interpretation post-ﬁeldwork. The microdrone-derived data show two near-perpendicular fracture sets in the NMB: ∼NNE–SSW and ∼ESE–WNW, with some variation along the coastline. Overall, we determined that microdrones offer ﬁeld-based geoscientists a valuable tool due to quick deployment, a simple image capture process and relatively straightforward data processing, and thus predict that this approach to enhancing ﬁeldwork will continue to advance.},

              Slow slip and tremor is observed along many subduction margins and is commonly linked to fluid pressure variations and migration. Accurate estimates of porosity and permeability around subduction megathrust shear zones are vital for understanding fluid‐seismicity interactions. We use high‐resolution digital outcrop data and (micro)structural analysis to assess transient permeability and porosity of a deep‐seated subduction interface exposed on Syros Island, Greece. We document the orientations, relative timing, and opening aperture (based on crack‐seal textures) of veins that were emplaced synkinematically with ductile deformation during early exhumation within the subduction channel. Our findings indicate high permeability through vein‐filled fractures amidst a lower permeability matrix, with transient, fracture‐controlled permeabilities ranging from 10

            Plain Language Summary
            Understanding the physical mechanisms of fast and slow slip in subduction zones requires knowledge on how rocks respond when they are squeezed, fractured and deformed (rheology). Recent numerical studies show that fluid flow through rocks (permeability) is important in controlling their slip response. Geophysical and geological observations also suggest that fluids can cause mechanical instabilities, but quantitative data from natural observations is extremely scarce. To address this gap, we developed a new methodology to quantify the permeability of these rocks from natural observations. We study in detail the geometry, distribution and microstructures of vein systems (former paleo‐fractures filled with fluids) that opened and allowed for transient fluid circulation. From these data, we quantify the paleo‐permeability associated with these former fractures and compare our results to previous investigations and explore their implications in the frame of plate interface rheology and slip.

            Understanding the natural fracture network is essential for geothermal-related investigations. However, the geometrical attributes depend on the scale of observation. Therefore, a multiscale characterization of the fracture network is essential to ensure that heat and flow simulations are based on stochastically generated discrete fracture network models representative of the natural fracture system observed. The objective of this project was to understand the scale effect of fracture data on the performance of a potential enhanced geothermal system in crystalline rock in northern Canada. This was accomplished by collecting and characterizing fracture data from core, outcrops and satellite image, and then constructing a discrete fracture network model which was used to simulate the performance of the geothermal system. The numerical simulations suggest that fracture length and spacing have an important impact on its performance. Thermal short-circuiting can be easily achieved if the fracture network is modelled based solely on satellite image data, and hydroshearing may be less effective if the DFN is constructed based solely on outcrop data. The simulations suggest that combining the different datasets provides the best compromise between heat extraction, water losses, hydraulic impedance and thermal drawdown. Despite the uncertainties, the fracture data used highlights the importance of multiscale fracture analysis for heat-flow simulations of geothermal reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Semi-automated algorithms incorporating multi-sourced datasets into a single analysis are increasingly common, but until now operate at a fixed pixel resolution resulting in multi-sourced methods being limited by the largest input pixel size. Multi-scale lineament detection circumvents this issue and allows increased levels of detail to be captured. We present a semi-automated method using a bottom-up Object-Based Image Analysis approach to map regional lineaments to a high level of detail. The method is applied to onshore light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and offshore bathymetry around the Land's End Granite (Cornwall, UK). The method uses three different pixel resolutions to extract detailed lineaments across a 700 km
              2
              area. The granite displays large-scale NW–SE fault zones that are considered analogous to those being targeted as onshore deep geothermal reservoirs (2–5 km in depth). Investigation of the lineaments derived from this study shows along-strike variations from NW–SE orientations within granite to NNW–SSE within slate and reflects structural inheritance of early Variscan structures within Devonian slates. This is furthered by analysing these major structures for reservoir potential. Lineaments proximal to these broadly NW–SE features indicate that a damage zone
              c.
              100–200 m wide is present. These observations provide a preliminary understanding of reservoir characteristics for fault-hosted geothermal systems.

	abstract = {A three‐dimensional (3‐D) stochastic network model for simulating a hot dry rock (HDR) or hot wet rock (HWR) engineered geothermal system formed in fractured crystalline rock is presented. The model addresses the problems of fracture network characterization from in situ field data, such as fracture orientation, size, spacing, and other mechanical properties. The model can simulate the changes that occur within the rock mass during stimulation (i.e., large volume fluid injection at pressures sufficient to allow shear slip on natural fractures). It can also be used to simulate steady state circulation of the heat exchange system thus created and includes provision for predicting tracer response curves and heat extraction history. The model has been applied to data gathered during the stimulation and circulation of a 2.2‐km‐deep HDR reservoir at Hijiori, Japan. The predicted shape of the stimulated and shear‐propped fractures closely matched the distribution of seismic source distribution of acoustic emission (AE), regardless of realization of the fracture network, suggesting that the geometry of the stimulated volume can be robustly predicted from knowledge of the fracture population and in situ stresses. However, hydraulic behavior and tracer tests during the circulation could only be satisfactorily simultaneously reproduced by a small subset of realizations. These selected realizations, obtained by matching initial circulation and tracer data, are considered to give the best prospect of satisfactory long‐term thermal modeling. The success in simultaneously modeling diverse data (hydraulic, microseismic, and tracer) lends confidence to the thermal predictions. The results indicate that a large improvement in the long‐term thermal performance of the Hijiori reservoir could result from increasing well spacing from 100 to 150 m without major degradation of the hydraulic performance.},

	abstract = {Fracture studies commonly lack data for the length range between 10 m to 1 km. For this reason, scaling laws are required to extrapolate fracture properties, for example in discrete fracture network models. This study focused on analysis and correlation of topology, orientation and length distribution of multiscale fracture datasets to assess their scalability. The used datasets comprise UAV-derived photogrammetric models from natural outcrops and lineaments mapped using airborne LiDAR, bathymetry and aerogeophysical data, in several contrasting scales and resolutions. This study highlights challenges in acquiring uncensored and coherent brittle structural datasets from source data characterized by a large span of resolutions between the remote sensing datasets and models of the fractured outcrop. In specific, collected data was found to be potentially biased and affected by uncertainties related to both the censoring by sedimentary cover and the scale of observation. Our results revealed differences between lineament and outcrop fracture orientations, as well as difficulties in assessing topological parameters from lineament datasets. The 1:200000 resolution was found best suited to the mapping of lineament length and resulted in a length distribution power law exponent of -1.92. For outcrop fractures that are less than 2 m long, the lognormal length distribution provided the only good fit to our data, while the longer outcrop fractures fitted relatively well with a power law exponent of -2.26.},

	abstract = {To simulate a suitable fracture network for hydrogeological modelling, input statistical data of the individual faults, as well as fracture sets, should be determined ﬁrst using either 2D sections or 1D scanlines. Although the accuracy of this measurement is fundamental, exact determination is rather problematic and is usually possible only at a particular scale. This paper introduces a coupled method for computing length exponent (E) and spatial density (Dc), the two most essential parameters for modelling fracture networks. To calculate the length exponent, data sets of at least two independent imaging processes are needed. Utilizing different sensitivity thresholds of the two methods and the well-known analytical form of a fracture length distribution function, its parameters can be calculated. To estimate the spatial density of fracture centres in 3D, the series of intersections should be analysed as a fractional Brownian motion and then calibrated with virtual wells simulated with optional modelling software. The method makes fracture intensity logging possible along scanlines. Based on these approaches, there is no need to import fracture parameters from the outcrop survey or from other parts of the reservoir, because all geometric information of the fracture system refers to the rock body under examination. Using sitespeciﬁc parameters makes fracture network modelling more reliable.},

Microfractures in 16 specimens from two drillholes were analysed and used as a basis for fractal geometry-based discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling. It was concluded that the difference in resistivity between pegmatoid granite (PGR) and veined gneiss (VGN) specimens of similar porosity was likely due to differences in the types of microfractures. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed from microfracture analysis and simulation: fractures in gneiss were short and mostly in one preferred orientation, whereas the fractures in granite were longer and had two preferred orientations. This may be due to microstructure differences of the rock types or could suggests that gneiss and granite may suffer different types of excavation damage. No dependencies on depth from the excavated surface were observed in the geometric parameters of the microfractures. This suggests that the excavation damaged zone cannot be identiﬁed based on the changes in the parameters of the microfracture networks, and that the disturbed layer observed by geophysical methods may be caused by macro-scale fractures.},

The multilayer perceptron (MLP) machine learning approach, combined with the inverse CDF method, generates random variables following any sampling distribution. We extend the Newman–Ziff algorithm to determine clusters in the fracture networks and make the code faster. When combined with the block method, the coding efficiency is further enhanced. The software generates the T-type fracture intersections in the network by simulating a fracture growth process, which can be used in applications involving fracture growth or incorporating geomechanics. Three applications of HatchFrac are introduced to demonstrate the versatility of our software: percolation analysis, fracture intensity analysis, and flow and connectivity analysis.},

	abstract = {Quantitative assessment of the flow properties and mechanical stability of naturally fractured rock is frequently practiced across the mining, petroleum, geothermal, geological disposal, construction, and environmental remediation industries. These fluid and mechanical behaviours are strongly influenced by the connectivity of the fracture system and the size of the intact rock blocks. However, these are amongst the more difficult fracture system properties to characterise and honour in numerical simulations. Nonetheless, they are still the product of interactions between fractures that can be conceptualised as a series of deformation events following geomechanical principles. Generating numerical models of fracture networks by simulating this deformation with a coupled and evolving rock mass and stress field is a significant undertaking. Instead, large scale fracture network models can be ‘grown’ dynamically according to rules that mimic the underlying mechanical processes and deformation history. This paper explores a computationally efficient rules-based method to generate fracture networks, demonstrates how different types of fracture patterns can be simulated, and illustrates how inclusion of fracture interactions can affect flow and mechanical properties. Relative to methods without fracture interaction and in contrast to some other rules-based approaches, the method described here regularises and increases fracture connectivity and decreases flow channelling.},

Superposed networks can consist of different types of extension or shear fractures, and each fracture may abut, cross or follow (reactivate) earlier fractures. An example of a superposed fracture network in Liassic limestones in Somerset, UK, is presented, which comprises two sets of veins and a later joint network. The veins develop as damage zones around faults, with veins of the later set crossing or trailing along the earlier set. The later joints either cross-cut the earlier veins or reactivate them, the latter being common for the thicker (more than about 5 mm) veins. The veins and joint networks have markedly different geometries and topologies. The veins are spatially clustered and are typically dominated by I-nodes, while the joints are more evenly distributed and tend to be dominated by Y-nodes. The combined network of veins and joints at Lilstock is dominated by X-nodes because so many joints cross-cut the earlier veins. Understanding the development of superposed fracture networks leads to better understanding of the kinematic, mechanical, tectonic and fluid flow history of rocks.},

The leaky confined aquifer system developed in the glacial sediments overlying the bedrock. Location, dimension, and connectivity of bedrock deformation zones constitute a big uncertainty in the 3D geological model. To image sediments and bedrock structures, we acquired 2D multicomponent seismic data using a nodal system and planted 3-C geophones as receivers and an electrically driven seismic vibrator (E-vib) operating in both the P- and S-wave mode as a source. Acquired 6-C data confirm the benefits and complementary nature of the P- and S-wave imaging in such conditions. Seismic interpretation was supported by the P-wave velocity models obtained from first-arrival tomography. Seismic data enabled us to map the bedrock surface with more details, determine the width of the bedrock fracture zones and the thickness of the weathered bedrock zone. New data also prove their utility in mapping glacial sediments, providing both the structural control and lithology distribution through the changes in P-wave velocity. We demonstrate that seismic data can be considered a great asset in 3D modelling of the buried valleys aquifer system, reducing uncertainties introduced by conceptual models based on borehole data.},

Syntectonic granites are often replete with fractures of various attitudes, cross-cutting each other, which develop under the prevalent states of stress.

The study is conducted using finite-element-method (FEM) to assess the distribu­ tion of induced stresses within the porphyroclasts considering the geometry and varying mechanical properties of the porphyroclast and the embedding matrix. We infer that fractures in the porphyroclast develop due to amplification and concentration of far-field stresses within it. The direction of maximum principal compressive stress as indicated by the fractured porphyroclasts lies in close proximity to the paleostress direction derived from fault-slip analysis of adjacent bodies such as Chitradurga Schist Belt and Koppal syenite (Dharwar craton). Therefore, we advocate that fractured feldspar porphyroclasts are a reliable indicator of paleostress orientations.},

	abstract = {The high-angle faults bounding the High Agri Valley Basin eastwards are well-exposed at the Viggiano Mt., southern Italy. There, these faults crosscut Mesozoic shallow-water carbonates and permit the multiscale ana­ lyses of fault and fracture geometry and distribution. Aiming at assessing the control exerted by carbonate lithofacies and scales of observation, we combine field and digital structural analyses to compute the values of 1D and 2D fracture density and intensity, and the dimensional properties of single fault and fracture sets. As a result, from outcrop to reservoir scales we document a scale-variant geometry of faults and fractures, and the great variation of both fracture density and intensity among the studied carbonate lithofacies. Furthermore, we compute a P21 dimensional scaling factor of ca. 20 for over 3 order magnitude, whereas inconsistent results are achieved for the P20 values. Not considering the control exerted by the single carbonate lithofacies, at a reservoir scale we document that the small-scale faults greatly impact the computed P21 values.},

	abstract = {Joints are the most common result of brittle fracture of rock in the Earth's crust. They control the physiography of many spectacular landforms and play an important role in the transport of fluids. In its first century, the Geological Society of America Bulletin has published a significant number of papers on joints and jointing. One hundred years ago, there were lively debates in the literature about the origin of joints, and detailed descriptions of joints near the turn of the century catalogued most geometric features that we recognize on joints today. In the 1920s, theories relating joint orientation to the tectonic stress field and to other geologic structures led to a proliferation of data on the strike and dip of joints in different regions. The gathering of orientation data dominated work on joints for the next 50 yr. In the 1960s, key papers re-established the need to document surface textures, determine age relations, and measure relative displacements across joints in order to interpret their origins. At about this time, fundamental relationships from the fields of continuum and fracture mechanics were first used to understand the process of jointing. In the past two decades, we have witnessed an effort to use field data to interpret the kinematics of jointing and to understand the initiation, propagation, interaction, and termination of joints. Theoretical methods have been developed to study the evolution of joint sets and the mechanical response of a jointed rock mass to tectonic loading. Although many interesting problems remain to be explored, a sound conceptual and theoretical framework is now available to guide research into the next century.},

	url = {https://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-29-9571-4},
	abstract = {Geological studies over the Arabian Peninsula were initiated in the 1930s, and 30 years later an area equivalent to 3.5 million km2 was covered, laying the groundwork for the stratigraphic nomenclature of the Arabian Peninsula. Since then, not much has changed in terms of formation ages and formation naming, where subsequent authors largely took the results of the earlier work for granted. This thesis will evaluate the sedimentological and depositional facies of exposed rock units in the countries of Kuwait and Bahrain with the objective of developing a depositional facies model that can explain the complex facies architecture. During this study, it was revealed that the exposed rock units in Kuwait at the Jal Az-Zor escarpment all belong to the Lower Fars Formation (also known as Kuwait Formation), whereas previous interpretations assigned these rocks to Ghar, Lower Fars, and Dibdibba formations. This study further revealed that the depositional environment of the Lower Fars Formation is dominated by marginal marine deposits manifested by a riverine to tidally influenced estuary setting, which is contrasting to the fluvio-deltaic setting within previous interpretations. The origin of the NE-SW trending Jal Az-Zor escarpment has been disputed in Kuwait, where it has been proposed either a surface erosion expression, or an underlying unspecified basement fault. Detailed 2D seismic processing and interpretation revealed unprecedented structural features such as detachment, tight concentric and recumbent folds, thrust faults, and fault propagation folds. Tectonic deformation of the Kuwait Formation within the subsurface at the Jal Az-Zor escarpment reflects the initial stage of fault propagation folding resulting from the Kuwait Arch plunge towards the south of the Jal Az-Zor area. Kinematic analysis suggests that the Jal Az-Zor escarpment is a surface expression of a principal displacement zone that is dominated by dextral strike-slip motion and is found to play a major role in the rotation of the Arabian Plate since the early Pleistocene (Calabrian). Throughout this study, it has been observed that detachment could have occurred along the Dammam and Rus formations. Subsequent analysis of the composition of these two formations indicates that the Rus Formation exhibits a greater potential for generating detachment surfaces. The Rus Formation was earlier thought to be dominated by evaporites which favours detachment and was considered a regional seal covering the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. However, detailed sedimentological field work at the Horse-Racing Club outcrop in Bahrain and subsequent published borehole data suggest that the Rus Formation in Bahrain is predominantly composed of dolomites. These changes in understanding facies types and spatial distribution open the door for an in-depth evaluation of the whole Arabian Peninsula facies distribution. The complexity of the Arabian Peninsula's sedimentology and structural development was highlighted in this thesis, demonstrating the need for a re-evaluation of the region's facies nomenclature and tectonic history in light of current geological knowledge and newly available data.},

Attention to date has focused foremost on the consequences of biases in the spatial distribution of PAs for their effectiveness and efﬁciency in representing biodiversity. What is less clear is the extent to which these biases may also have affected the likelihood with which PAs coincide with or are inﬂuenced by particular kinds of threatening processes, further undermining their role. An obvious candidate for such concerns is metal mining activities. Here we demonstrate that approximately 7\% of mines for four key metals directly overlap with PAs and a further 27\% lie within 10 km of a PA boundary. Moreover, those PAs with mining activity within their boundaries constitute around 6\% of the total areal coverage of the global terrestrial PA system, and those with mining activity within or up to 10 km from their boundary constitute nearly 14\% of the total area. Given the distances over which mining activities can have inﬂuences, the persistence of their effects (often long after actual operations have closed down), and the rapidly growing demand for metals, there is an urgent need to limit or mitigate such conﬂicts.},

A basic prerequisite to enable access to domestic raw materials is information on raw material occurrences, current and past mining activities, resources and reserves.

            Crystalline basement rock aquifers underlie more than 20\% of the earth’s surface. However, owing to an inadequate understanding of geological structures, it is challenging to locate the groundwater resources in crystalline hard rock terranes. In these terranes, faults, fractures, and shear zones play an important role in bedrock weathering and ultimately groundwater storage. This study integrates important geological structures with 2D high-resolution subsurface resistivity images in understanding the factors that influenced bedrock weathering and groundwater. The results reveal the variability of weathered zone depth in different structural zones (Zone-I to Zone-IV). This is due to the presence of foliations, fractures, and faults. A thicker weathered zone develops when a fracture/fault overprints a pre-existing planar pervasive structure like foliations (Zone-II) as compared to zones only with faults/fractures (Zone-III). Further, the transmissivity of boreholes also shows relatively higher in Zone-II than Zone-III, which implies a good pact between different structural features and possible groundwater storage. The study also demonstrates the role of paleostress and different tectonic structures influencing the depth of the “Critical Zone”. While the geology may vary for different structural terranes, the approach presented in this paper can be readily adopted in mapping bedrock weathering and groundwater resources in crystalline basement terranes globally.},

	abstract = {Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have emerged as a powerful alternative tool for analyzing hyperspectral images (HSIs). Despite their impressive performance, current works strive to make GCN more sophisticated through either elaborate architecture or fancy training tricks, making them prohibitive for HSI data in practice. In this paper, we present a Graph Convolutional RVFL Network (GCRVFL), a simple but efficient GCN for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, we generalize the classic RVFL network into the graph domain by using graph convolution operations. This not only enables RVFL to handle graph-structured data, but also avoids iterative parameter adjustment by employing an efficient closed-form solution. Unlike previous works that perform HSI classification under a transductive framework, we regard HSI classification as a graph-level classification task, which makes GCRVFL scalable to large-scale HSI data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed GCRVFL is able to achieve competitive results with fewer trainable parameters and adjustable hyperparameters and higher computational efficiency. In particular, we show that our approach is comparable to many existing approaches, including deep CNN models (e.g., ResNet and DenseNet) and popular GCN models (e.g., SGC and APPNP).},

In the present paper, we describe permeability contrasts induced by cataclastic deformation bands and faults in porous sandstones (766 data synthesized from ﬁeld examples and the literature). We also discuss the inﬂuence of several factors, including tectonic regime, presence of a fault, burial depth, host sandstone porosity, and grain size and sorting for their initiation and permeability. This analysis conﬁrms that permeability decrease is as a function of grain-crushing intensity in bands. Permeability reduction ranges from very limited in crushmicrobreccia of compaction bands to high permeability reduction in cataclasites and ultracataclasites of shear-dominated bands, band clusters and faults. Tectonic regime, and especially normal-fault regime, with its tendency to localize strain and generate faults, is identiﬁed as the most important factor, leading to the formation of cataclastic bands with high permeability contrasts. Moreover, moderate burial depth (1e3 km) favors cataclastic bands with high permeability contrasts with respect to the host sandstone. High porosity, coarse-grain size and good grain sorting can slightly amplify the permeability reductions recorded in bands.},

In contrast to the widely used faceted representations, a smooth surface can be used to represent the fracture domain.

In the present work, an interaction-free deformation-informed surface modiﬁcation algorithm of the fracture is presented, with localized stress intensity factor computations, and automatic resolution adjustment, which allows for geometric evolution without the need of appending or re-approximating the fracture surface. The method is based on the movement of surface control points, and on the systematic editing of weights and knots; it does not require trimming, and is able to shift fracture shape and capture its path evolution efﬁciently. Throughout growth, the number of points required for fracture representation increases only as a function of curvature, but not area, and the discretization of the parametric surface is achieved in constant time. The proposed algorithm can be incorporated into any fracture propagation code that keeps track of fracture geometry and updates it as a function of deformation. Use of the algorithm is demonstrated for a discrete ﬁnite element-based fracture propagation method.},

	abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are highly anisotropic and heterogeneous, and thus require a variety of structural geology, geomechanical, remote sensing, geophysical and hydraulic techniques to inform Discrete Fracture Network flow models. Following the Paris Agreement on reduction of carbon emissions, such reservoirs have received more attention and new techniques that support Discrete Fracture Network models were developed. A comprehensive review is therefore needed to merge innovative and traditional technical approaches into a coherent framework to enhance the extraction of geothermal energy from the deep subsurface. Traditionally, statistics extracted from structural scanlines and unmanned aerial vehicle surveys on analogues represent optimum ways to constrain the length of joints, bedding planes, and faults, thereby generating a model of the network of fractures. Combining borehole images with seismic attributes has also proven to be an excellent approach that supports the stochastic generation of Discrete Fracture Network models by detecting the orientation, density, and dominant trends of the fractures in the reservoirs. However, to move forward to flow modelling, computation of transmissivities from pumping tests, and the determination of hydraulically active fractures allow the computation of the hydraulic aperture in permeable sedimentary rocks. The latter parameter is fundamental to simulating flow in a network of discrete fractures. The mechanical aperture can also be estimated based on the characterization of geomechanical parameters (Poisson’s ratio, and Young’s modulus) in Hot Dry Rocks of igneous-metamorphic origin. Compared with previous review studies, this paper will be the first to describe all the geological and hydro-geophysical techniques that inform Discrete Fracture Network development in geothermal frameworks. We therefore envisage that this paper represents a useful and holistic guide for future projects on preparing DFN models.},

These effects are important to be taken into account when evaluating the performance and lifetime particularly of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). In this paper, we compare the results from two dye tracer tests, conducted before (at ambi‑ent temperature of 13 ◦C ) and during the injection of 45 ◦C hot water into a fractured crystalline rock at the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland. Conducting a moment analysis on the recovered tracer residence time distribution (RTD) curves, we observe, after hot water injection, a significant decrease in the total tracer recovery. This recovery decrease strongly suggests that fluid flow was redistributed in the studied rock volume and that the majority of the injected water was lost to the far-field. Furthermore, using temperature measurements, obtained from the same locations as the tracer RTD curves, we conceptualize an approach to estimate the fracture surface area contribut‑ing to the heat exchange between the host rock and the circulating fluid. Our moment analysis and simplified estimation of fracture surface area provide insights into the hydraulic properties of the hydraulically active fracture system and the changes in fluid flow. Such insights are important to assess the heat exchange performance of a geo‑thermal formation during fluid circulation and to estimate the lifetime of the geother‑mal formation, particularly in EGS.},

To overcome this limitation, we present a finite element implementation of an Eulerian flow solver that is coupled to a Lagrangian solid mechanics solver, both in a sequential or tight manner. The flow simulator is successfully benchmarked for permeability computation on a digital rock that has been previously used for other code validations. The need for a tightly coupled hydro-mechanical simulator is then highlighted by comparing the loose and tight coupling approaches, revealing that the tight approach is more accurate and more efficient computationally.

	abstract = {The quantification of a rock mass’s internal structure and description of discontinuity properties is imperative for modern rock mass characterization. This study builds on decades of rock engineering development by reviewing and revising different parameters such as the rock quality designation ( RQD ), volumetric joint count ( Jv ), the Pij system and others. Analyses of these parameters are done by means of a Monte Carlo simulation that generated 5000 samples of discrete discontinuity networks including finite, folded and very low to very high discontinuity densities ( Jv range: 0.5–117 discontinuities/m3), thus representing a wide range of possible geological scenarios. P10 , P20 , P21 , P30 , P32 , RQD and the fractal dimension of the rock mass are virtually measured on these samples and a range of higher level parameters that are used in practical rock engineering computed and their relationships investigated. It is concluded that parameters which are based on subjective estimations of discontinuity spacing, the number of discontinuity sets or RQD are not suited to describe the rock mass structure in cases of demanding geological scenarios featuring many discontinuities, weak and anisotropic rock masses, metamorphic rock masses, folded rock masses, etc. By revising classical parameters and their relationships, this study contributes to basic rock mass characterization and furthermore paves the way for future developments by making the developed discrete discontinuity network dataset and all included codes openly accessible to the rock mechanics community.},

However, to date, there has been no standardization for the quantiﬁcation of rock fractures in surface process research. In this work, the case is made for standardization within fracture-focused research, and prior work is reviewed to identify various key datasets and methodologies. Then, a suite of standardized methods is presented as a starting “baseline” for fracture-based research in surface process studies. These methods have been shown in pre-existing work from structural geology, geotechnical engineering, and surface process disciplines to comprise best practices for the characterization of fractures in clasts and outcrops. This practical, accessible, and detailed guide can be readily employed across all fracture-focused weathering and geomorphology applications. The wide adoption of a baseline of data collected using the same methods will enable comparison and compilation of datasets among studies globally and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the links and feedbacks between rock fracture and landscape evolution.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Subsurface datasets typically lack the resolution or coverage to adequately sample fracture networks in 3D, and fracture properties are typically extrapolated from available data (e.g. seismic data or wellbore image logs). Here we assess the applicability of extrapolating fracture properties (orientation, length, and intensity) across observation scales in deformed, mechanically layered carbonate rocks. Data derived from high-resolution field images, medium-resolution digital outcrop data, and
relatively low-resolution satellite imagery at Swift Reservoir anticline, NW Montana are leveraged to (i) assess interacting structural and stratigraphic controls on fracture development, and (ii) compare estimated fracture properties derived from multiple observation scales. We show that
hinge-parallel and hinge-perpendicular fractures (i) make up the majority of fractures at the site; (ii) are consistently oriented with respect to the fold hinge, despite along-strike variability in the fold hinge orientation; and (iii) exhibit systematic increases in intensity towards the anticline hinge. These fractures are interpreted as having formed during folding. Other fractures recorded at the site exhibit inconsistent orientations, show no systematic trends in fracture intensity, and are interpreted as being unrelated to fold formation. Fracture orientation data exhibit the greatest agreement across observation scales at hinge and forelimb positions, where hinge-parallel and hinge-perpendicular fracture sets are well developed, and little agreement on the anticline backlimb, where fracture orientations are less predictable and more dispersed. This indicates that the scaling of fracture properties at Swift Reservoir anticline is spatially variable and partly dependent on structural position. Our results suggest that accurate prediction and extrapolation of natural fracture properties in contractional settings requires the assessment of structural position, lithologic variability, and spatially variable fracture scaling relationships, as well as consideration of the deformation history before and after folding.},

	abstract = {Threats posed by the climate crisis have created an urgent need for sustainable green energy. Geothermal resources have the potential to provide up to 150 GWe of sustainable energy by 2050. However, the key challenge in successfully locating and drilling geothermal wells is to understand how the heterogeneous structure of the subsurface controls the existence of exploitable fluid reservoirs. In this Review, we discuss how key geological factors contribute to the profitable utilization of intermediate-temperature to high-temperature geothermal resources for power generation. The main driver of geothermal activity is elevated crustal heat flow, which is focused in regions of active magmatism and/or crustal thinning. Permeable structures such as faults exercise a primary control on local fluid flow patterns, with most upflow zones residing in complex fault interaction zones. Major risks in geothermal resource assessment and operation include locating sufficient permeability for fluid extraction, in addition to declining reservoir pressure and the potential of induced seismicity. Advanced computational methods permit effective integration of multiple datasets and, thus, can reduce potential risks. Future innovations involve engineered geothermal systems as well as supercritical and offshore geothermal resources, which could greatly expand the global application of geothermal energy but require detailed knowledge of the respective geological conditions.},

Geological outcrops can only provide two-dimensional (2D) information, but subsurface fractures are three-dimensional (3D). The percolation status of 3D fracture networks and their 2D cross-section maps are rarely investigated simulta­ neously. In this work, we construct 3D fracture networks with their geometries characterized by different sto­ chastic distributions. Cross-section maps are taken to mimic real outcrops, and clusters are labeled to check the percolation status of 3D fracture networks and their 2D cross-section maps. The properties, reflecting the con­ nectivity of two essential phases, are summarized and analyzed. We find that clustering effects impact local intersections significantly but have negligible impacts on fracture intensities of 3D fracture networks. The number of intersections per fracture is not a proper percolation parameter for complex 2D and 3D fracture networks. Real fracture networks in the subsurface should be geometrically well-connected and over-percolative if their outcrop maps have a spanning cluster formed. Empirical limits are provided to predict the fracture in­ tensity and connectivity of subsurface 3D fracture networks based on their outcrop maps. If a spanning cluster is formed in the outcrop map, the corresponding 3D fracture networks should be over-percolative, and its fracture intensity can be larger than 3.5 times the intensity at percolation. However, if no spanning cluster is formed in the outcrop map, but the fracture intensity is larger than 0.43 times the intensity at percolation, the corre­ sponding 3D fracture networks can form a spanning cluster and show good connectivity.},

In this paper it is shown that limit analysis tends to overestimate stability due to the presence of potentially unrealistic dilatancy at the joints. To address this, a modiﬁed plastic limit analysis procedure incorporating a non-associative, low dilation, friction model is proposed. Originally developed to assess the stability of masonry walls, the procedure is here extended to allow an envelope of potential solutions to be obtained. The numerical results obtained are found to closely match both analytical and experimental results from the literature, demonstrating the signiﬁcant promise of the procedure.},

Smøla island, situated within the mid-Norwegian passive margin, contains crystalline-basement-hosted intricate fracture and fault arrays formed during a polyphase brittle tectonic evolution. Its detailed study may strengthen correlation attempts between the well-exposed onshore domain and the inaccessible offshore domain, further the understanding of the passive margin evolution, and provide useful constraints on petrophysical properties of fractured basement blocks. A combination of geophysical and remote sensing lineament analysis, field mapping, high-resolution drill hole logging, 3D modelling, petrographic and microstructural studies, and fault gouge K–Ar geochronology made it possible to define five deformation episodes (D1 to D5). These episodes occurred between the post-Caledonian evolution of the regional-scale Møre–Trøndelag Fault Complex (MTFC) and the Late Cretaceous and younger crustal extension preceding the final stages of Greenland–Norway break-up. Each reconstructed deformation stage is associated with different structural features, fault and fracture geometries, and kinematic patterns. Synkinematic mineralisations evolved progressively from epidote–prehnite, sericite–chlorite–calcite, chlorite–hematite, hematite–zeolite–calcite, to quartz–calcite. K–Ar geochronology constrains brittle deformation to discrete localisation events spanning from the Carboniferous to the Late Cretaceous. Multiscalar geometrical modelling at scales of 100, 10, and 1 m helps constrain the extent and size of the deformation zones of each deformation episode, with D2 structures exhibiting the greatest strike continuity and D1 features the most localised. Overall, the approach highlighted here is of great utility for unravelling complex brittle tectonic histories within basement volumes. It is also a prerequisite to constrain the dynamic evolution of the petrophysical properties of basement blocks.},

However, the computational cost of these simulations is often prohibitive for carrying out an adequate number of simulations to obtain stable statistics for many quantities of interest, including the ﬁrst passage time distribution (FPTD) of particles passing through the system. We characterize how variability induced by stochastic representations of subsurface fracture networks propagates into the FPTD. We simulate ﬂow and transport on a large ensemble of three-dimensional fracture networks, observe the quantiles of the ﬁrst passage time distributions, and characterize the network structure using coarse graph-based representations. Through analysis of the ﬁrst passage times and graphs, we identify key geostructural features which explain variation in the FPTD. These features integrate hydrological fracture properties (permeability) with topological attributes. Using these features, we ﬁt both parametric and nonparametric regression models to predict FPTD with uncertainty, compare the relative performance of each model in terms of error and coverage, and discuss possible model extensions. Models are validated using a held-out set of networks independently generated under different parameter settings. These nonparametric regression models can ﬂexibly account for nonlinear relationships while allowing prediction intervals to adjust accurately depending on input feature values.},

Given the connectivity and structure of a fracture network, the ﬂow in the system was solved using a linear system of algebraic equations for the pressure at the nodes of the network. With the ﬂow determined, the temperature in the fracture was solved by coupling convective heat transport in the fracture with one-dimensional heat conduction perpendicular to the fracture, employing the Green’s function derived solution for a single discrete fracture. The predicted temperatures along the fracture surfaces from the analytical solution were compared to numerical simulations using the TOUGH2 reservoir code. Through two case studies, we showed the capabilities of the analytical model and explored the effect of uncertainty in the fracture apertures and network structure on thermal performance. While both sources of uncertainty independently produce large variations in production temperature, uncertainty in the network structure, whenever present, had a predominant inﬂuence on thermal performance.},

	abstract = {Posiva Oy has chosen the Olkiluoto site in southwest Finland for the construction and operation
of a spent nuclear fuel repository at a depth of approximately 425 m. In-situ stress measurements
conducted at the site indicate significant variability in the principal stress magnitudes and
orientations. The in-situ stress state is a critical component affecting the rock mechanics of the
rock mass and must be thoroughly characterised for the design and performance assessment of an
underground repository for spent nuclear fuel. In Finland, the current in-situ stress field is
primarily caused by tectonic forces from Mid-Atlantic ridge push and the collision of the Eurasian
and African plates. Additionally, temporary reactivation of existing fault zones during the glacial
loading/unloading cycle of the previous Weichselian glaciation resulted in increased spatial
variability observed in the stress field today.
The purpose of this study was to analyse how the stress field in the bedrock surrounding the spent
nuclear fuel disposal facility at Olkiluoto evolved toward the current in-situ stress state through
tectonic thrusting and glacial loading/unloading interacting with the major fault zones at the site.
The primary objective of the study was to understand the range and causes of variability in stress
magnitudes and orientations at the repository depth, and to verify rock parameters. The study was
conducted using numerical modelling software FLAC3D. The simulation model included
significant planar faults representative of the geologic model of Olkiluoto. The in-situ stress state
in the model was established in two stages. In the first stage, tectonic forces were applied with
velocity boundary conditions and in the second stage, a glacial loading/unloading cycle with
associated pore pressure changes was incorporated into the simulation model. Sensitivity of the
results to fault zone shear strength was analysed by conducting several simulations using a range
of shear strength envelopes. In addition, two major thrust directions were applied: the mean trend
of the major principal stress axis at the repository depth as interpreted from the stress
measurements (112°/292°) and an approximation of the possible regional scale direction
(130°/310°). Higher fault zone shear strength parameters resulted in better correspondence
between simulated stress magnitudes and orientations to those observed at the site. Further
improvement with the regional scale thrust direction was only achieved when the shear strengths
were sufficiently high.
The simulations were able to predict stress magnitudes consistent with the measured values at the
site. The results indicate that tectonic thrust alone is not sufficient to fully explain the observed
variability in stress magnitudes and orientations. The introduction of the glacial cycle in the model
resulted in larger spatial variability in the stress field by decreasing stability of the fault zones and
causing consequent fault shearing affecting the stress field orientation and magnitude near the
fault zones. However, the simulated stress magnitudes show considerably less variability than
what is observed in the measurements, reflecting the effect of local heterogeneities in the rock
mass and smaller scale fault zones, which are difficult to incorporate into a large-scale model such
as used in this study. Other uncertainties include the selection of a combination of thrust direction
and fault zone shear strength along with disregarding a more complex geological and glacial
history. Nonetheless, the study reduced the uncertainty associated with the selection of
representative fault shear strength properties. Further, irrespective of the selected shear strength
value or thrust direction, the major low-angle fault zones create discontinuities in the stress field
delineating stress domains within the repository volume.

	url = {https://www.skb.com/publication/727008/R-04-48.pdf},
	abstract = {This report considers the present-day understanding and approaches to take into account
retention and transport processes in the performance assessment (PA) models used in
the evaluation of the long-term safety of deep geological repositories for radioactive
waste. It is a product of Work Package 2 in the RETROCK Concerted Action, a part of
EURATOM's research and training programme.
The processes emphasised in RETROCK are the influences of the flow field, matrix
diffusion, and sorption on radionuclide transport characteristics. These processes, and
radioactive decay, provide the key terms to the transport equations of the PA models.
The following processes are handled more cursorily: colloid-facilitated transport,
microbial activity, gas-mediated transport, precipitation/coprecipitation, and off-
diagonal Onsager processes.
The environment in question is saturated sparsely fractured rock in the repository far-
field. The fracture network offers flowpaths for the groundwater transporting radio-
nuclides away from a repository. The radionuclides in various chemical forms interact
physically and chemically with other matter in groundwater, fracture surfaces, fracture
infills and the rock matrix adjacent to the fractures. These interactions typically result in
significant retardation, and decay, of radionuclides compared to the velocity of the
groundwater.
The PA models usually take into account retention phenomena using simplified
concepts that are justified by their conservatism. They are complemented by a large
variety of more detailed and realistic process-specific models that can be used to
support the choice of data for PA models, as well as specific arguments made in safety
cases. While the fundamental understanding, the conceptualisations of the phenomena,
the models and the computing resources develop, the extensive data requirements often
become a most restrictive factor to the use of a model. The difficulties in obtaining data
tend to hinder the utilisation of the most realistic mechanistic models, but major
challenges are also encountered in obtaining relevant and defensible data for the
principal simplified PA models.
In the RETROCK project the current report serves as a tool for further judgement of
understanding and approaches, and for an assessment of the development needs.},

	abstract = {Olkiluoto Island, which is located in SW Finland, has been selected as the deep geological
repository for the high-level nuclear waste generated by the nuclear power plants operated by the
Finnish power companies TVO and Fortum, and the repository is expected to become operational
in the early 2020s. Posiva is an expert organisation responsible for the management and
implementation of the nuclear waste repository at Olkiluoto and is owned by TVO and Fortum.
Posiva submitted a construction licence application to the Finnish government in December 2012
and an integrated description of the Olkiluoto site, including its geology, was a part of the
background material. After their review, in early 2015, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety
Authority in Finland (STUK) gave a positive statement to the Ministry of Employment and the
Economy: "the final disposal facility designed by Posiva can be built to be safe". In 2016, the
Finnish Government granted a licence to Posiva for the construction of a final disposal facility for
spent nuclear fuel.
Posiva has continued updating the multidisciplinary site description, which is aiming at the last
licencing stage of the repository - the application of the operating licence. Understanding the
geology of Olkiluoto is a substantial part of the site description work. It is based on data from
hundreds of outcrops, tens of kilometers of drill core, extensive tunnel mapping programme and a
wide variety of geophysical investigations. The Palaeoproterozoic bedrock in Olkiluoto consists
of variably migmatised supracrustal high-grade metamorphic rocks: migmatized meta-pelites,
meta-arenites and intermediate, pyroclastic metavolcanites. They are intruded by Paleoproterozoic
felsic, granitic–tonalitic plutonic rocks and granitic pegmatoids, and diabase dikes. The rocks
were metamorphosed simultaneously with the different phases of ductile deformation.
Hydrothermal alteration at Olkiluoto can be subdivided into two different modes on the basis how
the fluids have proceeded in the rock mass: fracture- or veinlet-controlled alteration and pervasive
or disseminated alteration. The brittle deformation history of Olkiluoto can be reconstructed
through paleostress inversion of fault-slip data from outcrops and drill cores and from K-Ar ages
if fault gouge illites: seven distinct paleostress states can be identified, spanning in time from ca.
1.7 Ga to 1.0 Ga.},

	abstract = {DFN – Discrete Fracture Network – is primarily a modeling framework for fractured geological systems that aims to
integrate field data into simulations of flow and/or deformation. It is complementary to, or competing with, continuum methods with
both advantages of easily integrating the statistical properties of fracture networks, and of not assuming any homogenization scale.
The core element is the DFN conceptual model, which makes a functional link between data from different sources, prior knowledge
and medium models. We discuss some fundamental issues about this conceptual model, namely (i) the upscaling of small-scale
measurements to site-scale relationships, (ii) intrinsic variability versus geological determinism, (iii) the way to incorporate a priori
knowledge, (iv) the transformation of a statistical description into a medium model, (v) the critical characteristics (length scales,
scaling laws or physical properties) of fractures for a given DFN application. The main product of the DFN conceptual model is
medium models, whose role is to extrapolate/interpolate data with a faithful representation of the geological system. The way in
which fracture correlations are taken into account, or not, in the generation process plays an important control on the connectivity
and flow properties of medium models.},

Transport models designed with accurately constrained parameters are a fundamental prerequisite to assess the long-term safety of repositories constructed in deep formations. Focusing on geological disposal systems of HLW, this study comprehensively reviews the behavoir of radionuclides and transport processes in multi-scale fractured rocks. Three issues in transport modeling are emphasized: 1) determining parameters of radionuclide transport models in various scales from laboratory- to field-scale experiments, 2) upscaling physical and chemical parameters across scales, and 3) characterizing fracture structures for radionuclide transport simulations. A broad spectrum of contents is covered relevant to radionuclide transport, including laboratory and field scale experiments, analytical and numerical solutions, parameter upscaling, and conceptual model developments. This paper also discusses the latest progress of radionuclide migration in multi-scale fractured rocks and the most promising development trends in the future.

The inclusion of coupled processes in simulation models is challenged by the high aspect ratio of the fractures, the complex geometry of fracture networks, and the crucial impact of processes that completely change characteristics on the fracture-rock interface. This paper provides a general discussion of design principles for introducing fractures in simulators, and defines a framework for integrated modeling, discretization, and computer implementation. The framework is implemented in the open-source simulation software PorePy, which can serve as a flexible prototyping tool for multiphysics problems in fractured rocks. Based on a representation of the fractures and their intersections as lower-dimensional objects, we discuss data structures for mixed-dimensional grids, formulation of multiphysics problems, and discretizations that utilize existing software. We further present a Python implementation of these concepts in the PorePy open-source software tool, which is aimed at coupled simulation of flow and transport in threedimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and the reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow, poroelasticity, and fracture deformation in porous media. The flexibility of the framework is then illustrated by simulations of non-linearly coupled flow and transport and of injection-driven deformation of fractures. All results can be reproduced by openly available simulation scripts.},

The numerical modeling of the fracture network of the damage zones and their hydraulic pa­ rameters was performed using both commercial (Move®) and open source software (dfnWorks and PFLOTRAN). Move® was used to build a representative model of the fault zone using fracture spacing as a proxy, and to model the hydraulic parameters of the different fault domains. dfnWorks and PFLOTRAN were employed to infer the hydraulic parameters of the damage zones of the fault and then upscale these properties to an equivalent con­ tinuum domain, suitable for fluid flow simulations through the whole fault zone. Our findings show how even in a relatively small area it is possible to describe changes in terms of hydraulic properties of a fault zone and to build models capable to represent these variations.},

High-quality computational meshes for DFNs are ﬁrst generated using the conforming meshing approach FraC. Then, a tracer transport model implemented in the open-source code DuMux is used for simulating tracer transport driven by the advection-dispersion equation. We adopt the box method, a vertex-centered ﬁnite volume scheme for spatial discretization, which ensures concentration continuity and mass conservation at intersections between fractures. Numerical results on simple networks for validation purposes and on complex realistic DFNs are presented.

Although the accuracy of this measurement is fundamental, exact determination is rather problematic and is usually possible only at a particular scale. This paper introduces a coupled method for computing length exponent (E) and spatial density (Dc), the two most essential parameters for modelling fracture networks. To calculate the length exponent, data sets of at least two independent imaging processes are needed. Utilizing different sensitivity thresholds of the two methods and the well-known analytical form of a fracture length distribution function, its parameters can be calculated. To estimate the spatial density of fracture centres in 3D, the series of intersections should be analysed as a fractional Brownian motion and then calibrated with virtual wells simulated with optional modelling software. The method makes fracture intensity logging possible along scanlines. Based on these approaches, there is no need to import fracture parameters from the outcrop survey or from other parts of the reservoir, because all geometric information of the fracture system refers to the rock body under examination. Using sitespeciﬁc parameters makes fracture network modelling more reliable.},

Previous studies proved that the granitoid massif is rather heterogeneous in terms of lithological composition, brittle structure and hydrodynamic behaviour. A signiﬁcant part of the body consists of monzogranite, while other portions are more maﬁc in composition and are monzonites. As a result of at least three signiﬁcant brittle deformation events, the area is at present crosscut by wide shear zones that separate intensively fractured zones and poorly deformed domains among them. Due to late mineralization processes, some of these fractured zones are totally sealed and cannot conduct ﬂuids, while others are excellent migration pathways. The spatial distribution of these two types nevertheless does not show any systematics. Hydrodynamic behaviour clearly reﬂects this heterogeneous picture; in some places, hydraulic jumps as great as 25 m at compartment boundaries can be detected.},

And while there are many suggestions and comparisons of roughness parameters, those are usually not considered in models and experiments dealing with surface roughness. This makes those experiments and sim­ ulations difficult to reproduce and compare. Here, we present a MATLAB toolbox called FSAT to calculate the most common roughness parameters. FSAT provides scientists with an easy and accessible method to quanti­ tatively describe the surface and aperture characteristics of any given fracture independent of its geometrical dimension. Using FSAT, we investigate differences and similarities between roughness parameters that split a surface in profiles to surface measures that address triangulation based surfaces. For this, we split 10 samples of two types of sandstone, scanned their surfaces and determined their hydraulic aperture using Darcy tests. While surface measures are very sensitive to different rock types and allow a good separation between samples, profile parameters quantify more distinct features of the surface, allow analysis of anisotropy and give an overview about a surfaces heterogeneity by their statistical variation across a surface.},

There are several fractured metamorphic-basement HC reservoirs in the Pannonian Basin; one of the largest among them is the Szeghalom Dome in SE Hungary. Previous production and fluid inclusion data infer that in this case several unconnected fluid regimes must coexist in the basement, making modeling of the fracture network essential. Because the representative volume of a fractured rock mass is usually too large to measure hydraulic properties directly, stochastic calculations should be carried out, which are consistent with observed deformation history and stochastic patterns. Input statistical data (orientation, length, distribution, fractal dimension for fracture seeds) were determined for amphibolite and gneiss samples representing the Szeghalom Dome. Data were measured simultaneously using binocular microscope and computerized X-ray tomography. Comparison of the two data sets suggests that they are comparable and both can be used for modeling. A new computer program, called REPSIM has been developed recently, which follows a fractal geometry-based discrete fracture network (DFN) algorithm to simulate the fracture network. The evaluation of simulated networks suggests that amphibolite and gneiss-dominated parts of the basement behave differently; large amphibolite bodies have a connected fracture network, while gneiss domains usually are well below the percolation threshold.},

To increase confidence and transparency in the repository safety case, the development philosophyfor GDSA Framework is based on (1)increasingly mechanistic representations of multi-physics couplings;(2)realistic threedimensional spatial resolution of features and processes, including explicit representation of all emplaced waste packages;and(3)appropriate quantification and propagation of uncertainties. The work described here summarizes the capabilities of GDSA Framework and its application to a generic repository conceptfor waste disposal in a crystalline host rock.},

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to better understand and quantify the flow structure in fractured rocks from flow logs, and to propose relevant indicators for validating, calibrating or even rejecting hydrogeological models. We first studied what the inflow distribution tells us about the permeability structure from a series of analyses: distribution of transmissivities as a function of depth, proportion of flowing sections as a function of section scale, and scaling of the arithmetically-averaged and geometrically-averaged permeability. We then define three indicators that describe few fundamental characteristics of the flow/permeability, whatever the scale: a percolation scale ls , the way permeability increases with scale above ls , and the variability of permeability. A 4th indicator on the representative elemental volume could in principle be defined but the data show that this volume/scale is beyond the 300 m investigated. We tested a series of numerical models built in three steps: the geo-DFN based on the observed fracture network, the open-DFN which is the part of the geo-DFN where fractures are open, and a transmissivity model applying on each fracture of the open-DFN (Discrete Fracture Network). The analysis of the models showed that the percolation scale is controlled by the open-DFN structure and that the percolation scale can be predicted from a scale analysis of the percolation parameter (basically, the third moment of the fracture size distribution that provides a measure of the network connectivity). The way permeability increases with scale above the percolation threshold is controlled by the transmissivity model and in particular by the dependence of the fracture transmissivity on either the orientation of the fractures via a stresscontrolled transmissivity or their size or both. The comparison with data on the first two indicators shows that a model that matches the characteristics of the geo-DFN with an open fraction of 15\% as measured adequately fits the data provided that the large fractures remain open and that the fracture transmissivity model is well selected. Most of the other models show unacceptable differences with data but other models or model combinations has still to be explored beforerejecting them.},

The bulk of the original work consisted mainly of ﬁnding common objects which will work for these different modeling methods without changing a single line of the C++ code. With this approach it is possible to add new numerical models by only plugging-in the corresponding formulas. The advantages of the resulting YADE framework are the following: (1) generic design provides great ﬂexibility when adding new scientiﬁc simulation code, (2) numerous simulation methods can be coupled within the same framework like for example DEM/FEM and (3) with the open-source philosophy, the community of users collaborate and improve the software. The YADE framework is a new emerging software, which can be downloaded at the http://yade.wikia.com webpage.},

	abstract = {Magma in the Earth’s crust is commonly transported through dikes. Fractures and faults, which are common in the shallow crust, form structural weaknesses that can act as energy-efficient propagation pathways. Although examples of this are known from active and extinct volcanoes in varying host rocks, the conditions and mech­ anisms of how and when dikes are influenced by these structures are not yet fully understood. This study in­ vestigates how basaltic dikes propagating through hyaloclastite in the shallow crust interact with pre-existing fractures. Using virtual 3D-models from drone-based photogrammetry, we mapped basaltic dikes exposed in a caldera-filling hyaloclastite in the extinct Dyrfjo¨ll volcano, NE-Iceland, to measure the orientations of fractures and dikes, and quantify their interactions. We observe 39 changes in strike among 45 dikes and found a strong control of the governing stress field on orientations and interactions. Three types of dike-fracture interaction were identified: (1) Dikes propagating along pre-existing fractures. This is most frequently observed for dikes following the tectonic stress field. (2) Dikes with an abrupt change in strike occurring near or at a crosscutting fracture, but without magma flow into the fracture. (3) Dikes arrested at a crosscutting fracture. Such dikes may develop offshoots near the dike tip, which may approach the fracture at different angles and be able to cut across. Understanding how dikes interact with pre-existing fractures in moderately fractured host rock such as hyalo­ clastite is relevant for hazard assessment and monitoring of volcanically active areas.},

	title = {The relationship between brittle tectonics and bedrock morphology of {Central} {Fennoscandia}},
	url = {https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-7700.html},
	abstract = {The bedrock of Central Fennoscandia has been shaped by a long and complex geological history involving ductile deformation and metamorphism which dates back at least to the 1.9\&\#8211;1.8 Ga Svecofennian orogeny. Subsequent geological processes including Precambrian brittle faulting and fracturing, younger fault reactivations and several stages of hydrothermal activity and alteration processes, provided further contribution to defining the present-day bedrock structure and mechanical properties. Eventually, extensive glaciation affected the exposed upper part of the bedrock through structurally selective erosion, which is largely responsible for the morphology of the bedrock erosion surface. As such, the brittle tectonic history, involving faulting and fracturing near the Earth\&\#8217;s surface, has played a significant role in shaping the current bedrock topography. However, also the preceding ductile structures played a role as they caused the localisation of the brittle deformation through the process of structural inheritance.
Based on previously published results the brittle tectonic development within Central Fennoscandia initiated in response to N\&\#8211;S compression at around 1.75 Ga. Based on our new datasets, consisting of isotopically dated fault gouge samples and brittle structural observations (Nordb\&\#228;ck et al., 2022), N\&\#8211;S extension at around 1.65 Ga and a E\&\#8211;W extension at around 1.6 Ga were associated with 1) reactivations of previously formed major structures of the bedrock, 2) rapakivi magmatism and 3) the development of a (failed) continental rift between Finland and Sweden. Our structural data from within the 1.58 Ga rapakivi granites indicate that strike-slip tectonics prevailed during Mesoproterozoic times. According to isotopic and structural data from Olkiluoto in southwestern Finland, thrust faults were generated in response to E\&\#8211;W compression during the Sveconorwegian orogeny between 1.1\&\#8211;1.0 Ga. The younger stress changes that induced faulting activity, have been found to cause merely reactivations of the fault systems that were formed already by late Mesoproterozoic times. Based on our structural datasets from the 1.58 Ga rapakivi granites, paleostress analysis and observed relative age relationships between faults and joints, Neoproterozoic exhumation of the bedrock appears to have resulted in extensional bedrock stresses and the development of Precambrian bedrock joints.\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;
Erosional processes during the Quaternay glaciations interacted strongly with the existing brittle structures which were preferably eroded during the glacial advances and retreats. Especially the intensely fractured major fault zones greatly impacted the current bedrock morphology while smaller structures, such as individual joints or shear fractures, only have a local impact (Skytt\&\#228; et al., 2023).

	title = {Structural and flow modelling of bedrock fractures - a software perspective},
	url = {https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-7550.html},
	abstract = {Discontinuities of the bedrock, i.e. fractures, form the main pathways for fluid flow in crystalline rocks. For modelling purposes, fracture data can be gathered from e.g. bedrock outcrops and drillcores. Remote digitization of bedrock outcrops results in mostly two-dimensional fracture data while structural measurements in-situ and from drillcores results in three-dimensional data. The nowadays common digitized two-dimensional fracture trace data can be analysed for geometric (e.g. orientation and length) and topological properties (e.g. connectivity). For these purposes, specialized tools exist such as FracPaq (Healy et al., 2017), NetworkGT (Nyberg et al., 2018) and fractopo (Ovaskainen, 2023).
For three-dimensional fracture data analysis, the options become more sparse because as the data gains complexity through the addition of a dimension, so does the software required for analysis. This is especially the case for software that, rather than analysing fracture data, (also) generates it such as with discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling. DFN-modelling is required when fluid flow, reactive flow, geothermal flow, or contaminant transport properties of the fracture network need to be assessed at a scale larger than it is feasible to collect fracture data. Due to the added complexity, the available software for these purposes is varied and require specialized knowledge to use them effectively. In hydrocarbon exploration, geothermal exploitation and nuclear waste disposal, software such as FracMan (WSP trademark) is used for DFN-modelling and subsequent flow modelling. Although free and open-source options for DFN-modelling exist, they often lack user-friendly interfaces and lack the necessary manpower for further development outside of research purposes.\&\#160;
In FLOP (FLOw Pathways within faults and associated fracture systems in crystalline bedrock) -project we gather knowledge of the available free and open-source software for three-dimensional fracture data analysis and modelling. We integrate the found solutions with macro- and microscale fracture data from outcrops and X-ray CT-imaging, respectively, to investigate flow channeling. We also apply the more mature tools available for two-dimensional fracture trace analysis, such as fractopo (Ovaskainen, 2023), to characterize varied sampling locations where flow properties of field analogues will be studied.\&\#160;
The FLOP-project is funded by SAFER2028, a Finnish research programme on nuclear energy research, and the Geological Survey of Finland. The project is conducted in collaboration with the Deep-HEAT-Flows geothermal energy project.\&\#160;

	abstract = {Southern Finland crystalline basement was formed and modified during the 1.9\&\#8211;1.8 Ga Svecofennian orogeny, which constitutes a portion of the Fennoscandian Shield. The bedrock comprises supracrustal and early to late-orogenic igneous rocks of mafic to felsic compositions and is characterized by an overall high metamorphic grade associated with high-T and low-P conditions. The bedrock was subjected to multiple tectonic events of distributed deformation, first during a compressional stage, then followed by an extensional stage and finally \&\#160;a transpressional stage.Hence, the Kopparn\&\#228;s study site in southern Finland has been subjected to several stages of ductile and brittle deformation. The site has been studied by the Geological Survey of Finland for several years, with special research emphasize on a subvertical E\&\#8211;W orientated multi-core fault zone that intersects granites, amphibolites, and migmatites. A drillhole cuts through this fault zone at 100 m depth. This drillhole has beed studied using downhole instrumentation, such as optical and acoustic imaging and diverse geophysical surveys (fullwave sonic, magnetic susceptibility, gamma density, natural gamma radiation, drillhole caliper and various electrical loggings). In addition, a comprehensive study of the drill core enables detailed geological and petrophysical characterization of the fault architecture, including recognition of fractures, alteration zones, and mineralization across the fault and its host rocks. These studies together with fluid flow measurements with a packer system, enable us to define subsurface properties for this fault zone.The initial results suggest that faulting strongly impacts the petrophysical characteristics of the rock, typically increasing porosity and reducing bulk density. This change is most likely related to the fracturing at the site being often associated with mineral alteration and dissolution. These events altered and deformed the multiple fault cores in distinctively manner, affecting the subsurface fluid flow which can be observed in fluid chemical composition differences.These studies are part of the FLOP project (FLOw Pathways within faults and associated fracture systems in crystalline bedrock) and the Deep-HEAT geothermal energy project.\&\#160;},

This work proposes an integrated framework for obtaining fracture networks with real aperture distributions, based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of core plugs from naturally fractured rock formations. We adapt and employ segmentation, skeletonization and geometry generation algorithms that are available in open-source libraries and licensed software. In addition, we investigate the contributions of fractures and porous matrix to the equivalent permeability tensor through fluid flow simulations considering three different scenarios for the matrix permeability.
