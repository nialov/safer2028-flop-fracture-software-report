Modelling bedrock fractures three-dimensionally (3D) is necessary for many applications,
such as in site characterization for nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy
investigations. A number of software programs have been released for this purpose, with
many focusing on discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling, as it generates
fractures where they cannot be empirically detected. Depending on the use case,
such as for safety cases in nuclear waste disposal, it is important to consider
both the suitability of the software used for modelling and the future
availability of the software. It is uncertain whether proprietary,
i.e., paid software, will be available far into the future, as the company
behind the software has control over its use.

For this purpose, this report provides a review regarding the state of the
field for free and open source three-dimensional fracture modelling software,
with a focus on DFN-modelling. In total, this report reviews seven software,
and gathers information on the documentation, installation and practical usage
of the software. The software programs vary in terms of their focus, as some
have only been built to serve a very specific modelling purpose, such as
`Pychan3d` for channel network modelling. Some have a broader range of uses,
such as `dfnWorks` which has been applied in a variety of contexts, including
nuclear waste disposal investigations. In addition to containing programs to
generate fractures, many software programs also include subsequent flow
modelling capabilities and fracture generation is often coupled with the
following modelling. The review is useful for end-users such as nuclear waste
companies, safety regulators or anyone interested in 3D fracture
characterization as the contents can be used to, for instance, to find new
software for modelling and use the software to create models for comparison
with previous ones.
