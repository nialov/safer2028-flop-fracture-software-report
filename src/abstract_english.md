Modelling bedrock fractures three-dimensionally (3D) is necessary for many applications,
such as site characterization in nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy
investigations. A number of software programs have been released for this purpose, with
many focusing on discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling, as it generates
fractures where they can not be empirically detected. Depending on the use case,
such as for safety cases in nuclear waste disposal, it is important to consider
both the suitability of the software used for modelling and the future
availability of the software. It is uncertain whether proprietary,
i.e., paid software, will be available far into the future, as the company behind the
software has control over its use.

For this purpose, this report provides a state of the field for free and
open source three-dimensional fracture modelling software, with a focus on
DFN-modelling. In total, this report reviews TODO software, and gathers
information on the documentation, installation and practical usage of the
software. The software programs vary in terms of their focus, as some have only
been built to serve a very specific modelling purpose, such as `Pychan3d` for
channel network modelling. Some are more general purpose, such as `dfnWorks`
which has been applied in a variety of contexts, including nuclear waste
disposal investigations. In addition to containing programs to generate fractures,
many software programs also include subsequent flow modelling capabilities and
fracture generation is often coupled with the following modelling. 

A review such as this is useful for end-users such as nuclear waste companies,
safety regulators or anyone interested in 3D fracture characterization as the
contents can be used to, for instance, to find new software for modelling and
use the software to create models for comparison with previous ones.
